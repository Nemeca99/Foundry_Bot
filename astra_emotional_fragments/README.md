## ðŸŽ­ **Emotional Blending System**

### **`emotional_blender.py`**
A sophisticated system that combines multiple emotional fragments to create complex, nuanced emotional states.

#### **Features:**
- **Blend multiple emotions** to create new complex states
- **Weight-based blending** for realistic emotional combinations
- **Keyword matching** to find relevant emotions
- **Suggested combinations** for interesting emotional mixes

#### **Example Blends:**
- **Happy + Lustful** = Joyful desire

- **Jealous + Protective** = Possessive protection
- **Grateful + Submissive** = Thankful surrender

#### **Usage:**
```python
from emotional_blender import EmotionalBlender

blender = EmotionalBlender()

# Simple blend
happy_lustful = blender.blend_emotions("happy", ["lustful"])

# Complex blend with weights
complex_emotion = blender.create_complex_emotion(
    ["sad", "lustful", "grateful"], 
    [0.4, 0.8, 0.6]
)
```
