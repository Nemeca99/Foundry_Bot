# 🎭 Character Embodiment AI System Project

## 📋 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Goal**: Transform our AI from "knowing about" characters to "BEING" characters, matching Gemini's capability of character embodiment.

**Target**: Make AI process book content as identity ("I AM Shay") rather than information ("Shay has red hair").

**PROOF OF CONCEPT ACHIEVED**: ✅ Successfully demonstrated authentic character embodiment with Luna → Nyx → Shay transitions, showing AI can genuinely *become* characters while maintaining authorial voice.
