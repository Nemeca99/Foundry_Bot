# üé≠ Character Embodiment AI System Project

## üìã **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Goal**: Transform our AI from "knowing about" characters to "BEING" characters, matching Gemini's capability of character embodiment.

**Target**: Make AI process book content as identity ("I AM Shay") rather than information ("Shay has red hair").
