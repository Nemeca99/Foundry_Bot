# Enhanced Luna System Guide

## Overview

Luna is an AI writing companion with a sophisticated emotional system that uses global weight calculation to determine her emotional state. The system takes into account ALL emotions on both sides (lust and work) and calculates the final position as an average with the difference between weights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

### **Global Weight System**
- **Lust Words**: 24 different words with varying weights (0.2-0.5)
- **Work Words**: 25 different words with varying weights (0.3-0.5)
- **Weight Calculation**: Averages all detected words and applies the difference
- **Emotional Range**: 0.0 (pure lust) to 1.0 (pure work) with 0.5 (balanced)

### **Dual-Release Mechanism**
- **Sexual Release**: Triggered at 0.1 or below, returns to 0.5
- **Achievement Release**: Triggered at 0.9 or above, returns to 0.5
- **Natural Return**: Automatically returns to 0.5 when no triggers present

### **Discord Integration**
- Real-time emotional responses
- Detailed weight analysis
- Release event detection
- Interactive commands

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Global Weight Calculation**

```python
def calculate_global_weight(self, message: str) -> float:
    """Calculate global emotional weight based on ALL emotions in the message"""
    
    # Calculate lust and work averages
    lust_avg = sum(weight for word, weight in lust_weights.items() if word in message)
    work_avg = sum(weight for word, weight in work_weights.items() if word in message)
    
    # Calculate difference and apply to current level
    weight_difference = work_avg - lust_avg
    adjustment = weight_difference * 0.3
    
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, current_level + adjustment))
```
