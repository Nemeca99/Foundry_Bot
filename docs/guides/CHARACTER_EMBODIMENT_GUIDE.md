# üé≠ Character Embodiment System Guide

## üìã **OVERVIEW**

The Character Embodiment System transforms AI from "knowing about" characters to "BEING" characters, matching Gemini's capability of authentic character embodiment.

**Key Achievement**: AI processes book content as identity ("I AM Shay") rather than information ("Shay has red hair").
