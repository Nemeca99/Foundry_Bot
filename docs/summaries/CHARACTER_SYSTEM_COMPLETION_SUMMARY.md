```

### **Character Interaction Engine**
```python
# Character dialogue and interaction systems
create_character_dialogue_profile(character_name, speech_patterns)
generate_character_dialogue(speaker, listener, interaction_type, emotion)

get_relationship_dynamics(character_a, character_b)
```

### **Character Development System**
```python
# Character growth and evolution tracking

```python
# Add character memory
framework.add_character_memory("Shay", "personal_experience", "Shay discovered an ancient relic", "important")

# Get character memories
memories = framework.get_character_memories("Shay", "personal_experience")
# Result: List of character-specific memories

# Get character relationships
relationships = framework.get_character_relationships("Shay")
# Result: Character relationship network
```

### **Character Interaction**
```python
# Generate character dialogue
dialogue = framework.generate_character_dialogue("Shay", "Nyx", "conversation", "happy")
# Result: Character-specific dialogue with emotional context

# Create character interaction
interaction = framework.create_character_interaction("conversation", ["Shay", "Nyx"])
# Result: Structured interaction with dialogue history
```

### **Character Development**
```python
# Create character arc
arc = framework.create_character_arc("Shay", "Journey from village girl to adventurer", "introduction")

# Add development event
