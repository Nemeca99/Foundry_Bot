# Astra Emotional Fragments

## Overview

The `astra_emotional_fragments/` directory contains the sophisticated emotional system that powers Luna's authentic emotional intelligence. This system features a **global weight calculation** that takes ALL emotions into account, creating dynamic, realistic emotional responses with a dual-release mechanism. **ALL EMOTIONAL SYSTEMS NOW HAVE COMPREHENSIVE QUEUE INTEGRATION!**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Components**

### **enhanced_emotional_meter.py**
The heart of Luna's emotional system with global weight calculation and queue integration:

- **Global Weight System**: 49 emotional words (24 lust + 25 work) with sophisticated calculation
- **Dual-Release Mechanism**: Sexual release (0.1â†“) and achievement release (0.9â†‘)
- **Natural Return**: Automatically returns to 0.5 (balanced state)
- **Real-time Processing**: < 100ms response time
- **State Persistence**: Saves emotional state between sessions
- **Queue Integration**: Queue-based emotional processing operations

### **emotional_blender.py**
Enhanced emotional blending with psychological models and queue integration:

- **Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions**: 8 primary emotions with intensity levels
- **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**: Psychological need-based emotional modeling
- **Emotional Complexity Analysis**: Sophisticated emotional state scoring
- **Psychological Realism**: Authentic emotional responses based on psychology
- **Queue Integration**: Queue-based emotional blending operations

### **dynamic_emotion_engine.py**
Dynamic emotion adaptation and context switching with queue integration:

- **Context Detection**: Identifies emotional context changes
- **Smooth Transitions**: Natural emotional state transitions
- **Psychological Readiness**: Determines readiness for emotional shifts
- **Adaptive Responses**: Context-aware emotional responses
- **Queue Integration**: Queue-based dynamic emotion processing

## ðŸ”„ **COMPREHENSIVE QUEUE SYSTEM**

### **Queue System Integration**
The emotional system integrates with the comprehensive queue system for scalable, loosely-coupled architecture:

- **EmotionalMeter**: Queue-based emotional meter operations
- **EmotionalBlender**: Queue-based emotional blending operations
- **DynamicEmotionEngine**: Queue-based dynamic emotion processing operations
- **EmotionalStorage**: Queue-based emotional state storage operations
- **EmotionalManagement**: Queue-based emotional state management operations

### **Queue System Benefits**
1. **Loose Coupling**: Emotional systems communicate without direct dependencies
2. **Bottleneck Detection**: Queue monitoring identifies performance issues
3. **Error Isolation**: Failures in emotional operations don't affect other systems
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Emotional systems can be scaled independently
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting

### **Emotional System Queue Integration Pattern**
```python
class EnhancedEmotionalMeter(QueueProcessor):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("enhanced_emotional_meter")
        # Emotional meter initialization
    
    def _process_item(self, item):
        """Process queue items for emotional meter operations"""
        operation_type = item.data.get("type", "unknown")
        
        if operation_type == "update_emotion":
            return self._handle_update_emotion(item.data)
        elif operation_type == "get_emotional_state":
            return self._handle_get_emotional_state(item.data)
        elif operation_type == "reset_emotion":
            return self._handle_reset_emotion(item.data)
        else:
            return super()._process_item(item)
```

## ðŸŒŸ **Global Weight System**

### **Weight Calculation**
```python
def calculate_global_weight(self, message: str) -> float:
    """Calculate global emotional weight based on ALL emotions in the message"""
    
    # Calculate lust and work averages
    lust_avg = sum(weight for word, weight in lust_weights.items() if word in message)
    work_avg = sum(weight for word, weight in work_weights.items() if word in message)
    
    # Calculate difference and apply to current level
    weight_difference = work_avg - lust_avg
    adjustment = weight_difference * 0.3
    
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, current_level + adjustment))
```

### **Lust Words (24 total)**
- **High Intensity**: "lust" (0.5), "burning" (0.5), "desperate" (0.5), "feverish" (0.5)

]

for message in messages:
    result = meter.update_emotion_with_global_weight(message)
    print(f"'{message}' â†’ Level: {result['new_level']:.3f} - {result['state']}")
    
    if result.get('release_event'):
        print("ðŸ’¥ ACHIEVEMENT RELEASE!")
        break
```

### **Mixed Emotions**
```python
# Mixed emotional content
message = "You're beautiful but I need to focus on my writing"
result = meter.update_emotion_with_global_weight(message)

print(f"Level: {result['new_level']:.3f}")
print(f"State: {result['state']}")

# Show weight analysis
weight_calc = result.get('global_weight_calculation', {})
print(f"Lust: {weight_calc.get('lust_average', 0):.3f}")
print(f"Work: {weight_calc.get('work_average', 0):.3f}")
