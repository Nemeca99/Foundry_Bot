  - `emotion_transition`: Handle context switches and smooth transitions
  - `context_update`: Handle context change detection and psychological updates
  - `emotion_query`: Handle current state, history, and psychological readiness
  - `psychological_update`: Handle Maslow and Plutchik state updates
  - `emotion_generation`: Handle realistic response generation

### 3. Scripts

#### BotLauncher (`scripts/start_bot.py`)
- **Inheritance**: Now inherits from `QueueProcessor`
- **Queue Types Handled**:
  - `start_bot`: Handle bot startup operations
  - `stop_bot`: Handle bot shutdown operations
  - `bot_status`: Handle bot status queries
  - `restart_bot`: Handle bot restart operations

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Queue Processing Architecture
- All components now inherit from `QueueProcessor` base class
- Standardized `_process_item()` method implementation
- Error handling with detailed logging and fallback responses
- Loose coupling between systems via queue-based communication

### 2. Inter-System Communication
- Systems can communicate without direct dependencies
- Queue-based message passing for all operations
- Automatic system registration with `QueueManager`
- Bidirectional communication support

### 3. Error Handling and Resilience
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks in all queue handlers
- Detailed error logging with context information
- Graceful fallback responses for failed operations
- System stability maintained even with invalid requests

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
- Queue size monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Processing time tracking and bottleneck detection
- Alert callbacks for critical conditions
- Real-time system health monitoring

## Test Results

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **6/6 tests passed** âœ…
- All Discord bots queue integration tests passed
- All emotional systems queue integration tests passed
- All scripts queue integration tests passed
- Inter-system communication tests passed
- Queue monitoring and alerting tests passed
- Error handling tests passed

### Test Coverage
1. **Discord Bots Queue Integration**: Tests AuthoringBot and CharacterSystemBot
2. **Emotional Systems Queue Integration**: Tests EnhancedEmotionalMeter and EnhancedDynamicEmotionEngine
3. **Scripts Queue Integration**: Tests BotLauncher
4. **Inter-System Communication**: Tests communication between different systems
5. **Queue Monitoring**: Tests alert thresholds and monitoring capabilities
6. **Error Handling**: Tests resilience with invalid data

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. System Stability
- Reduced direct dependencies between components
- Improved error isolation and recovery
- Better resource management through queue buffering

### 2. Scalability
- Asynchronous processing capabilities
- Load balancing through queue distribution
- Horizontal scaling support via queue-based architecture

### 3. Maintainability
- Standardized queue processing patterns
- Centralized error handling and logging
- Clear separation of concerns between systems

### 4. Monitoring and Debugging
- Real-time queue monitoring and statistics
- Bottleneck identification and alerting
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Implementation Details

### Queue Item Structure
```python
@dataclass
class QueueItem:
    id: str                    # Unique identifier
    source_system: str         # Originating system
    target_system: str         # Destination system
    data: Any                  # Operation data
    priority: int = 5          # Processing priority (1-10)
    timestamp: float           # Creation timestamp
    retry_count: int = 0       # Retry attempts
    max_retries: int = 3       # Maximum retry attempts
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]   # Additional metadata
```

### Processing Pattern
```python
def _process_item(self, item):
    """Process queue items for system operations"""
    try:
        # Extract operation type from data
        operation_type = item.data.get("type", "unknown")
        
        if operation_type == "specific_operation":
            return self._handle_specific_operation(item.data)
        # ... other operation types
        else:
            # Pass unknown types to base class
            return super()._process_item(item)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing queue item: {e}")
        return {"error": str(e), "status": "failed"}
```

## Future Enhancements

- Predictive bottleneck detection
- Performance trend analysis
- Automated scaling recommendations

## Conclusion

The comprehensive queue system integration has been successfully implemented across all major components of the Foundry Bot project. This implementation provides:
