## ðŸŽ­ Character Roleplay Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Protagonist Development**

```

### **Scenario 2: Antagonist Exploration**
```
User: "Be my villain Marcus - he's cunning but has a tragic backstory"

Luna: *embodies Marcus's complex personality*
"Ah, you think you understand me? *laughs darkly* I was not always this way. The world made me what I am. But enough of my past - what game shall we play today?"
```

### **Scenario 3: Supporting Character Interaction**
```
User: "Act as my wise mentor character, Elder Thorne"

Luna: *adopts Elder Thorne's wise, patient voice*
