Ashley sits in her driveway in her car, the light mist of rain covers her windshield. The heater on a comfortable temperature, her phone saying its 32F outside. Her phone dimly lights up the driver’s side with her in it as she feels a buzz from her phone. Looking down she opens the message she got, “Room 302 8pm.” Her heart started to beat faster; it’s happening. Shes been messaging this guy the past couple days she found him on one of those dating apps. She recently created an account with the understanding that she wouldn’t find anyone. Her being in her early 40’s it’s hard to find someone. It’s been a long time since she was touched by a man, her toy was her friend, but it wasn’t the same.



She doesn’t know why she created one after all this time. She rereads the words over and over again, should she leave him on read? Should she message back? Her heart is pounding in her chest as her palms start to get sweaty. Wiping her hands on her jeans to cry them she types a message, “Ok, see you there”. Her finger hovers over the send button on her phone. 



Her mind is racing as she looks at the time, 7:09pm. Taking a deep breath and then breathing it out she tries to relax but it doesn’t work. She tries to turn on the radio, it starts playing some hit pop music. “You got this girl, you wanted this.” trying to talk herself up. Sitting back up in the seat she puts the car into reverse. Backing out of her driveway she feels her phone buzz again, stopping she looks at it. “Sounds good, I look forward to spending time with you.” her face blushes as she reads the message but still nervous as all hell. 



She doesn’t respond back but instead finishing backing out of her driveway and then forward down the street. She looks at the clock that’s on her dash, 7:14pm. “I got time, you can do this Ash.” Her GPS on her phone shows she’s only 10 minuets away from the hotel. Reaching her destination she pulls into the hotel parking lot, it’s sparse. She only sees 3 other vehicles, pulling into an empty space putting the car into park she leaves it running.



Looking at her phone it shows 7:26pm, she’s early so taking this time she gathers herself. She has seen pictures of this man and only conversed through text. Never in all her years has she done something like this, but it does excite her. She can feel a warmth start between her legs as her heart races more. Grabbing her purse she leaves her car, locking it and heads inside. 



The hotel is a standard chain layout, nothing fancy but it’s clean and quiet. An employee sits behind the desk not even old enough to drink it looks like, he sits their head in his hand as she watches something on his phone. Ashley steps up the desk and clears her throat, the boy looks up, “Hello, Welcome to the 4 Clover Hotel. Will you be staying the night?” setting his phone down he looks at Ashley.



“I am here meeting someone, Room 302 I believe.” She nervously says. 



The employee points to the elevator in the lobby, “Up the elevator and take a right.” He goes back to his phone as she nods, “Elevator to the right.” whispering to herself. Looking at her phone she starts walking towards the elevator the time shows 7:33. Shes early but sends a text to him, “In the elevator be there shortly.” she gets a text back immediately. “Doors unlocked.”



As she enters the elevator hitting the 3rd floor button the doors start to close as the elevator dings. Feeling it take off her heart feels like it’s about to jump out of her chest. Fidgeting with her purse strap she watches the floor indicator, L….1….2….3. As the number 3 appears the elevator slows down to a stop, dinging and opening the doors she walks out her legs feel like Jello, it’s hard to breath. Exiting the elevator, she sits on a chair in the hallway. 



“You got this Ash, he may be younger, but you deserve this, you need this.” She speaks to herself in her mind her eyes can see door 302 close to her. She can hear a tv going from that direction, random shuffling and banging as well. Looking at her phone it shows 7:40 now. “A few more minutes.” she says getting up, she starts to wander around trying to calm herself. Lost in thoughts and actions of it she finds herself in front of door 302. Never once in her life did, she think a door would be this scary. Looking at the handle of the door she puts her hand on it, the cool metal presses against her hand as she squeezes on the handle. Her hand moist from sweat, she lets out a breath and opens the door. Unlocked like he said it was, as she enters the room the bed is partly covered by the corner of the wall. To her right is the bathroom, “I’m going to go bathroom first if that’s ok.” She doesn’t even wait for a response as she darts into it.



Closing the door behind her she locks it, then setting her purse on the sink counter she pulls down her jeans and panties as she sits on the toilet. She can hear something get up from the bed and walk towards the door, three knocks are heard. “You, ok?” the man says through the door. “Yea, just nervous and had to pee sorry.” she says back right away trying not to sound to scared. “Well, I’ll be out here when you are ready.” his voice trails off as he walks away, the tv is turned back up as he lays back down on the bed.



Ashley slowly starts to pee as she relaxes, opening up her phone she starts to browse the web trying to distract her. Finishing up she stands up pulling her panties and pants back up. Flushing the toilet she steps to the sink, turning the water on and starts to wash her hands. As she does, she looks into the mirror, her makeup slightly messed up. Touching it up from the makeup case in her purse she is satisfied. She prepped her body before this, she trimmed her private area, her legs, armpits. She got a haircut and wash today; she went all out. Stepping back from the sink she grabs her purse, her hand on the lock of the bathroom. “Let’s do this.”



As the lock is unlocked and she opens the door stepping out into the room, she stands around the corner out of sight. “Hi….so…I don’t know what to do…” she says leaning against the wall her hands playing with the strap of the purse. A male voice comes from the bed around the corner, “Why don’t we just talk for a bit huh? We don’t have to do anything more than that if you don’t want to.” 



She nods to herself as she steps around the corner seeing each other for the first time other than the pictures they both put on their profile. He was lying in bed she estimates around 6-foot-tall man in his mid 20’s, wearing blue jeans and a black t-shirt. No socks on, his hand propped behind him as he leans back on the headboard the remote in the other hand. His hair was brown and short, his eyes have this blue hue that reminds her of the ocean. His eyes look at her as she stands there in her coat playing with her purse strap.



His eyes are filled with lust as he looks at her, she’s only 5’3 in her early 40’s, her brown jacket and blue jeans with a cute little white purse. Her hair all done up; her makeup accentuates her face. She sets her purse down as she reaches for the zipper of her coat. Unzipping it he sees her top, it’s a very nice sweater and under that is a long sleeve shirt. As she turns to face him his dick twitches a little when he sees her standing there in front of her at the end of the bed. She pulls the sweater off to show her shirt underneath, it’s just a red long sleeve shirt. But his eyes look past that and see her breasts, they look to be around B-C-cup range, the shirt is tight to her body as it only enhances her. 



“So?” she spins around to give him a better view. “You look amazing, are you sure you're in your 40’s? You could be a college girl.” he says with a smile sitting more straight up in the bed. “Well, you certainly are a charmer huh.” her face blushing. She walks to the other side of the bed and sits down; he scoots over to give her space and room. 



Getting into the bed she kicks off her shoes and lays down, leaning against the headboard like him. “Thank you.” she says. “For what?” he asks turning down the tv volume. “For being nice and understanding, I haven’t been with a man in a long time.” she looks down, playing with the hem of her shirt. 



“Well, you are cute. But hey, no pressure ok I mean it. I don’t want you to do anything you don’t want to.” His head turning towards her. “Besides, who knows what will happen. We can take it one thing at a time, nice and slow, ok?” 



She nods, “Yea, that sounds good.” Her face turns to him as she gets off the bed and heads towards the mini fridge, her eyes automatically look at his crotch, she can see a small bulge there her thighs get moister as her mouth dries up a little. Licking her lips she blushes and looks at the fridge. Opening it up she can see some random beverages inside it, pulling out a can of Mt. Dew he looks at her, “Thirsty?” holding up the can towards her. “More than you know.” her thoughts invade her mind. Leaning forward she takes the can from him and opens it; she’s not a huge soda drinker but she needs something right now.



Grabbing a can for himself he walks back towards his side of the bed and gets back in, sipping on the soda then setting it on the bedside table. Shes does the same, the sugar hit’s her lips as she shakes her head. “Wow, that’s got a kick.” she burps slightly as he chuckles at her. “I don’t normally drink soda.” she takes another sip then sets it on her bedside table. 



“So, you're a software engineer?” she asks.



He nods as he gets more comfortable on the bed, “Yea I went to college and got a I.T. degree, didn’t know what I wanted to do. Just wanted to work with computers you know?” he’s now laying on his side facing her, his head in his hand. “I enjoy the job; I have only been there for a short time. I started as an intern at first, but now that I finished school, they hired me full time. You?”



She looks down at his face as his eyes look into her, her heart races. “Well, I worked as a teacher for awhile but the money wasn’t good enough anymore, so I had to get a secretary job instead. Nothing fancy, answering phones all day and setting up meetings. Generic corporate stuff.” Her body heats up as she looks into his eyes, its like they are melting away her nerves.



“Thats cool, so like what did you teach?” he asks, his hand slowly inches across the bed. “Third graders mostly. I wanted a high school teaching position, but nothing was available, so I went with elementary. They are just as bad as the highschoolers don’t let anyone fool you.” she starts to ramble on about her days of teaching as his hand slides over hers. She stops mid-sentence and looks down to see his hand in hers. They lock eyes for a few moments, leaning down she gently kisses his lips. Pulling away, a smile is across both of their faces. His hand grabs her as he leans up, taking your head into his other hand he leans in and this time his lips connect with hers for longer. His soft lips caressing hers, his tougne slowly parts her lips and enters her mouth. They mingle together as he climbs on top of her, sliding her body down on her back. Him sitting over her, his lips locked with hers.



Using her hands raise up and touch his back, feeling it up and down. His back is rock solid, as he moves, she can feel his muscles move under his skin. Tracing her fingers over the shirt where the muscles on his back are, her body heats up more. Giving back to him she meets his kissing to match, her tongue now darts into his mouth. Not leaving his lips, she uses her body to roll him over onto his back as she climbs on top of him, her intimate area pressing against his, she can feel his bulge growing and twitching under his jeans. Moving her hips slightly over his jeans her hands grasp his hair, their kissing turning into a more intense one. Her hips rock back and forth, her breathing increases, her heart races. She squeezes his head and hair and her mouth presses into his, her body tenses up as her private area starts to pulse, she feels a small wave across her body as it stiffens up. As the wave calms down, she breaks from his lips.



Sitting on top of him she pulls off her shirt, revealing to him her lacy black bra. His hands explore her sides, running up them. Shes got some fat but not a lot. His hands feel like magic as they are warm on her sides, a shiver runs up her spine. His hands exploring what they can reach as they make their way to their destination. Feeling the lacey bra underneath his hands, gently massages them as he plays with the nipple that is poking just a bit. His thumbs circle and gently play with the bit that’s poking out, causing her body to heat up even more. 



Using her hands she places them on top of his as he plays with her breasts, helping him out pressing his hands more firmly onto her. He takes note as she releases her hands, reaching behind her unhooking the bra it falls forward as he releases his hands. Throwing the bra off the bed and onto the floor, his hands go back to her breasts. She lets out a gasp as his hands explore her naked breasts, his fingers twisting and circling her nipples. Her hips sway back and forth more as he hands brace against his chest, his hands causing her body to turn into fire. Taking note from before he gets more aggressive with his hands, squeezing the breasts in his hands. His fingers pulling and playing with her nipples, her wetness grows more and more to the point she can now smell how turned on she is right now. A small wave of pleasure crashing over her body as she gives out a little. His hands removing from her breasts her breathing increasing. 



She smirks as she slides down his body, her breasts pressing back and forth against his chest. Giving him a good view of it, she then slides up until her breasts are in his face. Pressing down into his face smothering him with them, his mouth trying to catch her nipples in his mouth. When he succeeds her mouth opens wide, “Fuck.” he sucks on one of her nipples while her other breast is being playing with his hand. Not choosing one over the other he goes back and forth, his tongue flicking the nipple, his teeth barely sinking into them. Her body ignites as she releases her first real orgasm, her whole body shakes violently as he continues to suck and play with her breasts. 



As the apex of the orgasm hits, she lifts up from him and slides down his body, hungerly she reaches for his jeans button. Undoing it she franticly wants his pants off now. He lifts his ass as she slides his jeans down, he kicks them off as they hit the ground. Her eyes locked onto his member, lowering her body down she licks the top of his dick. Tasting the small amount of precum she smiles, “Tastes good.” she whispers to him seductively. Going back down she uses one hand to hold the base of his shaft while her mouth just takes the tip in, gently swirling her tongue around the head as she flicks it between the opening on top of it. Her lips soft, her mouth moist. He moans as he closes his eyes relaxing, “Just relax let me take care of you now.” she says as she rubs her breasts against his rock-hard dick, taking his dick between her breasts she rubs up and down on his shaft. Slowly spitting on it his dick to help lube it as it slides between her breasts and into her mouth. 



He moans more as he clearly is enjoying it, taking her que, she moves back and then takes more of his dick into her mouth. His mouth opens as he gasps and mouths the words “Oh my god.” smiling as she takes his rock-hard member into her mouth she tries to take more but with little experience lately she can’t deepthroat him. He doesn’t care, his face is full of pleasure and a smile that’s wider than his face. Taking joy in giving him pleasure she gets more tense, sucking on the tip as she flicks and swirls her tongue around it. His body twitches as his head are very sensitive. Using that she grabs his shaft with her hand and strokes him while she sucks harder on his head. His hips lifting into the air as she releases her suction and strokes him hard. His body tenses up as he grabs the bedsheets. His dick stiff in her hands as she stops and let’s go, his hips fall to the bed as he lets go of the sheets, his chest is moving up and down fast as he is catching his breath. 



As she smiles at him, his face is that of confusion and lust. As she slides off his body and standing up at the foot of the bed, she slides her jeans down revealing a matching pair of panties to her bra. Her body is stunning for her age, a few wrinkles here and there natural signs of ageing but otherwise perfect. His dick twitches as he watches her undress in front of him, his eyes locked onto her panties as she slides them off. Her trimmed bush on display to him as he catches a glint from the moistness that as dripped down her legs.



She climbs back onto the bed as she climbs over him, reaching his face her lips kiss his, “Eat me.” she demands as she bites on his ear. Without another word he lifts her up off her and flips her on her back, on top of her now he kisses her lips and then down her chin, then her neck, to her breasts. Making sure to massage them and suck on the nipples as she pushes his head down, “Just eat me now.” she demands as her breathing intensifies. His face moves down her body to between her legs, she can feel his breath against her. It feels cooler vs how hot she is. His hands explore her legs and thighs as she spreads open for him giving him all the access he needs. She looks down to see his face vanish between her legs as she feels something soft and wet touch her. Her head flopping backwards as her back arches, his tongue sliding between her lips and to her clit as he circles it with his tongue. Her body reacting as she grips his hair with one hand and plays with her breasts with the other. 



Using his hands to spread her open more to give full view of her little pink clit. Taking it into his mouth gently sucking on it. His teeth gently bites down on it as he licks the top of her clit. Her back arches more as she grips his hair with all her might using two hands now, “Yes, yes yes, right there.” her chest breathing hard as she feels something. He continues working his tongue, his fingers now finding their way into her put her over the edge as she squeezes her thighs around his head hard as she can as her whole body quivers and shakes. Her grip on his hair is tight as she pulls on it, the wave of pleasure that’s crashing over her body, sending waves that start from her clit and radiate out from it, boucing inside her. More and more it grows, his mouth not stopping, her body feels like it’s about to lift off as she clamps down one more time and lets out a loud scream, “OH MY GOD!!!!!” as she does her grip on his head with her hands and thighs release as she squirts a tiny amount from her pussy and onto his face. As his head lifts from between her legs, she has one thing to say. “Fuck me. Take me. Make me yours.”



He smiles as he slides up between your legs, his stiff member pressing against her pulsating pussy. Grabbing his dick, he guides it to her opening, as he presses, she can feel his big mushroom tip trying to penetrate her tight unused hole. As she relaxes, he pushes past that barrier, a small gasp leaves her lips as she relaxes. Feeling it now sliding into her wet pussy stretching it out somewhat. She can feel him pressing against her walls on the inside. Her hands reaching for his face as he leans down, grabbing his face she pulls him into her. Her wet soft lips press into his with lust, her tongue exploring inside his mouth. Feeling him slowly thrust in and out of her, feeling him pressed against inside her. His rock-hard dick hitting a spot inside her that she didn’t know existed, every time he hits it her body tenses up. 



Breaking the kiss for a second, “Deeper, fill me, use me.” she whispers to him, her words filled with lust.



He breaks the kiss as he pulls out of her, “Get on your knees.” without hesitation she flips over and gets on her knees, her ass up in the air towards him. Using his knees he positions himself behind her, his warm soft hands grabbing her hips as he effortlessly slides back into her. A whole new sensation inside her as she can feel him even deeper. His face pressed into the bed he starts to slowly thrust in and out of her, her body reacting and pushing back against him matching his thrust, “I said, deeper.” turning her head enough for him to hear.



Feeling a change in pace he grips her hips harder as he thrusts hard into her with enough force that it pushes her foward slightly. She pushes back into him trying to get him deeper, each push his balls slap against her clit as she feels and hear him slam into her. His pace quickens as he starts to fuck her harder and harder. Her breathing intensifying with each thrust, “Yes, yes,yes….yes….yes…” she can only say one thing as her mind is filled with pleasure, all the matters is this young thick cock inside her pussy. Using her, pounding her, she wants it, she wants it all. 



Her body tenses up as her pussy grips down on his dick, his dick feels like it’s growing more inside her. Her body reaches climax clamping down on him, he doesnt stop but increases his pace. His body slamming into hers, the bed hitting the wall with each thrust. Her moaning in pleasure and ecstasy. “Fill me, give me your seed, breed me!”



With a final thrust he buries his dick as deep as he inside her, she feels his dick pulse as it spurts out its thick hot white cum inside her. Sending her over the edge she screams in ecstasy lifiting her body up by her hands, he contines to pound her. Each thrust sending a wave across her body, mergeing with the others. Each thrust, each wave enhancing the previous ones. Her body gives out as she releases again, another orgasm rushes across her body as she gives up and lays flat on her chest. He pulls out, juices from both parties mixed and falls onto the bed. Pooling between her legs she can feel the dampness of the sheets against her skin. He sits on his knees behind her, his breath heavy. Trying to catch it. 



Her on the bed doing the same, “That….that…was…wow…” catching her breath she flips over, her body like jello. As she using her arms to prop herself against the headboard. Looking down in the middle of the bed is a giant wet spot, he smiles as they both look at it. He gets off the bed and stands up, stretching. His dick still semi hard, cum leaking from it onto the floor. Her body shivers, when it does she has a mini orgasm. Feeling the heat between her legs she reaches down, using her finger running he between her thighs and into her. Bringing her finger to her mouth, sliding into it. She sucks on it licking the finger clean, “Very tasty.”



He chuckles as he walks into the bathroom, turning the shower on. She hears him open the shower door, then peaking his head out of the bathroom. 



“Well, you going to join me?”
