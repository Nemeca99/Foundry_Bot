Dr. Sarah Moon sat in a cold, dimly lit interrogation room, the logo of the SCP Foundation proudly displayed on her oversized lab coat. The air was dry and sanitized, a product of Site-58's robust ventilation system. The entire site was just as regulated, with thousands of internal systems operating around the clock to maintain nominal operating procedures around the site. Sitting with her legs crossed as she rested her hands on the table. Her stature was small, but her demeanor gave the impression of someone much more imposing and intimidating. In Dr. Moon's mind, she was already formulating a line of questioning for the incoming SCP. She was to interview and study a newly contained SCP, a human with anomalous properties that were sparsely understood by the Foundation. Just down the hall, a group of Mobile Task Force agents escorted the SCP to the interrogation room.



As the hydraulics of the door to the room opened with a hiss, the SCP was in an orange prisoner's jumpsuit, restrained by three men, and was more or less dragged into the room. Dr. Moon simply observed the subject's behavior, looking for anything in their behavior that could be used as a baseline during the interview. The Mobile Task Force agents stood in the room, keeping a close eye on the SCP. As the SCP was shoved into the chair, Dr. Moon focused on her goal here today. She leaned into the microphone, never taking her purple eyes off the person behind the glass.



"SCP-8642, I am here today to conduct a preliminary interview with you. You will tell me everything about yourself, and you will answer all my questions. I will review your mental state and whatever harm you may pose to us and the world as a whole."



Dr. Moon's high-pitched voice was cold and clinical as she spoke. Her voice was unnerving in the face of what was before her as if the anomalous and the dangers posed by it were nothing more than another data point to consider. She reached down to a small device sitting on top of the table, flicking the red button on the recording device and returned her emotionless gaze to the SCP. As the recording device whirred to life, the dull thrum of Reality Drive Anchors drummed in the background. If the SCP attempted to use their abilities unprompted, the reality anchors would simply negate the effects. Dr. Moon had always appreciated these devices, they always made her job easier, it made the anomalies more compliant.



"Beginning Interview Log A-1 with SCP-8642. Please state your name and how you're feeling."



The entity sat in the chair across from Dr. Moon. His appearance is that of a normal human, but his eyes are more cat-like. In the darkness, his eyes light up in a dim yellow. The entity tilts its head from side to side, studying the doctor's actions. The entity opens its mouth as words slowly form in a very neutral tone.



"S..c..p..8..6..4..2"



The entity then looks at the Dr. Moon as it talks to the guards in the room. Shifting its gaze from one guard to the other one as they guard the exit from this room.



"S..c..p..8..6..4..2"



The entity shifts slightly as it’s body in the chair, images formed with the movements the entity makes, almost like he left behind a ghost as he shifted in the seat.



"S..c..p..8..6..4..2"



Dr. Moon's eyes narrowed slightly at the entity's repetitive response. She leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table as she studied the SCP's unusual eye color and the strange, shadowy afterimage it left behind upon moving. Her mind raced with hypotheses about the nature of this anomaly.



"SCP-8642, I am aware of your designation. However, I require more information. Please state your before to containment and describe your anomalous properties in detail."



She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place. Dr. Moon's voice remained calm and clinical, despite the growing curiosity and excitement she felt at the prospect of unraveling the mysteries of this new SCP.



"Your cooperation will greatly assist in the development of appropriate containment procedures. Failure to comply may result in more... invasive methods of information extraction."



Her threat was delivered without emotion, a simple statement of fact. Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of impatience. She was eager to delve deeper into the entity's psyche and determine the extent of its anomalous capabilities.



"Now, please, begin your explanation. Start with your name and proceed chronologically."



"S...c...p...8...6....4...2"



The entity tilts its head again as it says it to Dr. Moon. His tone still neutral showing no signs of emotion on his face or his words.



"S...c...p.....M..o..o...n..."



The entity turns its head slowly as it’s eyes lock onto to one of the guards in the room.



"S...c...p....G...a...r...y..."



Turning it’s head to look at the camera in the corner of the room the entity slowly stands up as it walks very slowly and with grace. Every step is planned and thought out. Yet his movements are deliberate as they are efficient. Standing below the camera in the corner of the wall the entity stares into it his emotionless expression gazes into the lens of the camera as a red light slowly blinks on top of it.



"S ...c...p.....A...n....n...e..."



Tilting its head, its eyes dim slightly as it’s reflection is shown in the lens of the camera.



"S..c...p.......B...i...l...l....y...."



Dr. Moon watched intently as the entity, SCP-8642, rose from its seat with a fluid, almost predatory grace. Its movements were calculated and efficient, each step deliberate and purposeful. As it approached the camera in the corner, Dr. Moon couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. Something was unsettling about the way it tilted its head, its cat-like eyes glowing in the dim light.

She leaned back in her chair, her fingers steeped beneath her chin as she studied the entity's behavior. Its repetitive speech patterns and lack of emotional response were curious, to say the least. Dr. Moon's mind raced with possibilities, trying to piece together the puzzle that was SCP-8642.



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice steady and calm, "the repeated utterance of your designation suggests a level of fixation or obsession. Is this a coping mechanism? A form of self-identification? Please, elaborate on your thought process."



As she spoke, Dr. Moon's gaze flickered to the guards, ensuring they remained vigilant. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place. She knew that the entity's anomalous properties posed a potential threat, but she was determined to understand them fully.



"Your movements and the shadowy afterimage you leave behind are also of great interest. Are these properties inherent to your being, or are they a result of some external influence? Please, provide any information you can about your origins and the extent of your abilities."



Dr. Moon's eyes narrowed slightly, her focus unwavering. She was determined to unravel the mysteries of SCP-8642, no matter the cost. Her dedication to the Foundation's mission drove her forward, pushing her to delve deeper into the entity's psyche and determine the best course of action for its containment.

The entity stops mid-sentence as Dr. Moon speaks to it. The entity seems to ignore her. She gets more annoyed at it. Before she can speak the entity vanishes into a puff of black mist as it reappears behind Dr. Moon. Leaning down the scp sniffs the Dr. As it vanishes again and appears in the chair it originally got up from.



"Scp"



The entity's words are more formed but still have a very neutral tone.



"What....is.....scp...."



The entity's eyes glow brighter yellow.



"What....is... scp...."



The entity keeps repeating it over and over again, its tone shifting from a neutral one to a more annoyed one.



"What....is....scp....."



Dr. Moon's eyes widened slightly as SCP-8642 vanished into a puff of black mist, reappearing behind her in an instant. She could feel its breath on the back of her neck as it leaned in close, sniffing her. A shiver ran down her spine, but she maintained her composure, refusing to let the entity's unsettling behavior fluster her.

As quickly as it had appeared, SCP-8642 vanished again, rematerializing in the chair it had originally occupied. Dr. Moon watched as its eyes began to glow a brighter yellow, its tone shifting from neutral to annoyed as it repeated the same question over and over again.



"What... is... SCP..."



Dr. Moon leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table as she studied the entity's behavior. Its fixation on the term "SCP" was curious, and she couldn't help but wonder if it held some significance beyond its designation as a Special Containment Procedure.



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice calm and even, "the term 'SCP' refers to the Special Containment Procedures put in place by the Foundation to ensure the safety of both our personnel and the general public. It is a designation given to anomalous objects, entities, or phenomena that require containment."



She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place.

"Your repeated questioning suggests a level of confusion or uncertainty. Is there something specific you wish to know about your designation or the procedures put in place for your containment?"



Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of impatience. She was eager to delve deeper into the entity's psyche and determine the extent of its anomalous capabilities, but she knew that patience was key in these situations. She would need to approach this methodically, piece by piece until she had a clear understanding of the puzzle that was SCP-8642.

The entity listens closely to the doctor as its response is neutral again. She seemed to be pleased.



"Prisoner."



Then the entity starts speaking in a language that has never been heard by humans. Its words are so quick and it all sounds distorted.

Pausing he asks the Dr.



"I'm in prison. Let go. Unlock. Demand."



The words are very neutral in tone. The entity from the doctor's knowledge so far seems to indicate that it's not a threat....yet.

Dr. Moon listened intently as SCP-8642 spoke in an unknown language, its words rapid and distorted. She couldn't understand a single syllable, but the entity's tone and body language suggested a sense of urgency, perhaps even desperation.

When it switched back to English, its demand to be released was clear and concise. Dr. Moon's eyes narrowed slightly, her mind racing with possibilities. Was this a test of some kind? A ploy to gauge her reaction? Or was it a genuine plea for freedom?



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice calm and measured, "your request for release is noted. However, it is not within my authority to grant such a request. Your containment is a necessary precaution, given the nature of your anomalous properties."



She leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table as she studied the entity's face. Its cat-like eyes seemed to glow brighter in the dim light, and Dr. Moon couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. There was something about this entity that was different from the others she had encountered.



"I must insist that you remain calm and cooperative. Your behavior thus far has been... unpredictable, to say the least. Any further attempts at escape or resistance will be met with appropriate force."



Dr. Moon's gaze flickered to the guards, a silent reminder of the reality anchors and other containment measures in place. She knew that the entity posed a potential threat, but she was determined to understand it fully.



"Now, I have a few more questions. Your earlier speech in an unknown language suggests a connection to a culture or society outside of our own. Can you provide any information about your origins or the nature of your people?"



She paused, her fingers steeped beneath her chin as she waited for the entity's response. Dr. Moon knew that the key to containing SCP-8642 lay in understanding its motivations and the extent of its powers. And she was determined to uncover every last detail, no matter how long it took.

the entity tilts its head as it holds up its arms with his wrists cuffed together.



"Unlock. No run. Will talk. Unlock. Demand. Now."



The entity starts repeating that sentence over and over again. As it does the lights in the room dim as its eyes brighten again.

His tone is still neutral.

Dr. Moon's eyes widened slightly as the lights in the room began to dim, casting an eerie glow on SCP-8642's face. Its eyes seemed to brighten in the darkness, its cat-like pupils dilating as it repeated its demand for release over and over again.



"Unlock. No run. Will talk. Unlock. Demand. Now."



Dr. Moon's mind raced with possibilities, trying to determine the best course of action. On one hand, the entity's insistence on cooperation suggested a willingness to communicate and share information. But on the other hand, its anomalous properties and the potential threat it posed couldn't be ignored.

She leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table as she studied the entity's face. Its neutral tone and emotionless expression made it difficult to gauge its true intentions, but Dr. Moon knew she had to make a decision.



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice calm and measured, "I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. However, I cannot grant your request for release at this time. Your containment is a necessary precaution, given the nature of your anomalous properties."



She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place.



"I am willing to listen to what you have to say, but it must be done within the confines of your containment cell. If you agree to this, I will personally ensure that your message is heard by the appropriate personnel."



Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of impatience. She knew that the entity posed a potential threat, but she was determined to understand it fully. And if that meant negotiating with it, then so be it.



"Do we have an agreement, SCP-8642? Will you cooperate and share your knowledge, in exchange for a fair hearing of your message?"

She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a gamble, but she was willing to take the risk if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

the entity grows restless.



"Unlock.. demand...will...talk..."



The entity grows impatient.



"Name. Not. 8...6...4...2"



The entity tilts its head as it leans in closer.



"Name."



Speaks in a language from before. Seeing as they can't understand the entities language it leans back and says



"Shadow."



The entity goes back to repeating the message from before.



"Unlock. Demand. Will talk. Demand. Unlock. Will talk."



Dr. Moon's eyes narrowed as SCP-8642 grew increasingly restless, its demand for release becoming more insistent with each passing moment. She couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her as the entity leaned in closer, its cat-like eyes seeming to bore into her very soul.



"Name. Not. 8...6...4...2"



The entity's words were clear and concise, leaving no room for misunderstanding. Dr. Moon's mind raced with possibilities, trying to determine the significance of this revelation. If the entity's true name was not the designation given to it by the Foundation, then what did it mean? And why was it so important to the entity that it be acknowledged by its true name?

As the entity spoke in its unknown language once more, Dr. Moon felt a chill run down her spine. She couldn't understand a single word, but the tone and cadence of its speech suggested a deep-seated emotion, perhaps even a sense of urgency or desperation.

When it leaned back and spoke the single word "Shadow," Dr. Moon's eyebrows raised slightly. Was this a clue to the entity's nature or abilities? Or was it simply a name, a label that the entity had chosen for itself?



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice calm and measured despite the growing tension in the room, "I understand your desire to be known by your true name. However, until we have a better understanding of your origins and the extent of your anomalous properties, we must continue to refer to you by your designated SCP number."

She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place.



"I am willing to listen to what you have to say, but it must be done within the confines of your containment cell. If you agree to this, I will personally ensure that your message is heard by the appropriate personnel."

Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of impatience. She knew that the entity posed a potential threat, but she was determined to understand it fully. And if that meant negotiating with it, then so be it.



"Do we have an agreement, SCP-8642? Will you cooperate and share your knowledge, in exchange for a fair hearing of your message?"



She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a gamble, but she was willing to take the risk if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

The entity grows very angry now, its eyes shifting from yellow to more red.



"Unlock now. Patience is thin. Cooperation if unlocked. No run. Promise."



The entity slowly slides its arms that are cuffed together across the table. Its body is covered in a layer of fur. Behind the entity you can see a tail that matches the rest of the body and starts to sway. It's clear it's partially enough like cats on earth.



"Nomad. Unlock. Nomad. Talk. No leave. Now here. Unlock."



Dr. Moon's eyes widened as SCP-8642's demeanor shifted, its eyes changing from a bright yellow to a menacing red. The entity's growing anger was palpable, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. This was a side of the entity she hadn't seen before, and it was clear that its patience was wearing thin.



"Unlock now. Patience is thin. Cooperation if unlocked. No run. Promise."



As the entity slid its cuffed arms across the table, Dr. Moon's gaze was drawn to the layer of fur that now covered its body. She had never seen anything like it before, and the sight of the feline-like tail swaying behind it only added to the surreal nature of the situation.

She leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table as she studied the entity's face. Its neutral tone had given way to a more aggressive, almost threatening demeanor. But despite the growing tension in the room, Dr. Moon remained calm and composed.



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice steady and measured, "I understand your frustration, but I cannot grant your request for release at this time. Your containment is a necessary precaution, given the nature of your anomalous properties and the potential threat you pose."

She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place.

"However, I am willing to consider a compromise. If you agree to provide us with more information about your origins and abilities, I will personally ensure that your message is heard by the appropriate personnel. We can conduct this interview in a more comfortable setting, with your restraints removed, provided that you remain calm and cooperative throughout the process."

Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of impatience. She knew that the entity posed a potential threat, but she was determined to understand it fully. And if that meant making concessions, then so be it.



"Do we have an agreement, SCP-8642? Will you cooperate and share your knowledge, in exchange for a more comfortable interview setting and the opportunity to have your message heard?"

She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a risk, but she was willing to take it if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

the entity's eyes turn from a red shade to the original yellow to a more greenish yellow color. His eyes seem to indicate his mood.



"Unlock me now. I don't run. Will give an answer. Can teleport. See night and dark. See auras. See the heat. Natural hunter. Not aggressive. No hurt humans. No reason. Unlock now..no harm. No mad. Unlock now."



The entity taps the table with his arms the metal of the cuffs clinking on the table. Its fur is a very matte black with no shine. In the darkness you can not make out the outline of it, only the eyes and the arms exposed to the light.

Dr. Moon's eyes narrowed as SCP-8642's eyes shifted from red to a more greenish yellow hue. The entity's mood seemed to be reflected in the color of its eyes, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her as it tapped its cuffed arms against the table, the metal clanking loudly in the otherwise quiet room.



"Unlock me now. I don't run. Will give an answer. Can teleport. See night and dark. See auras. See the heat. Natural hunter. Not aggressive. No hurt humans. No reason. Unlock now..no harm. No mad. Unlock now."



As the entity spoke, Dr. Moon's mind raced with possibilities. Its claims of being able to teleport, see auras and heat, and its identification as a natural hunter were all highly concerning. But its insistence that it had no aggressive intentions and no reason to harm humans was intriguing.

She leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table as she studied the entity's face. Its fur was matte black, blending seamlessly into the darkness of the room. Only its eyes and the exposed parts of its arms were visible in the dim light, giving it an almost spectral appearance.



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice calm and measured, "your abilities are indeed concerning, but I must emphasize the importance of your containment. Your anomalous properties pose a significant risk, and we cannot simply release you without proper protocols in place."



She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place.



"However, I am willing to consider a compromise. If you agree to provide us with more detailed information about your abilities and your origins, I will personally ensure that your message is heard by the appropriate personnel. We can conduct this interview in a more comfortable setting, with your restraints removed, provided that you remain calm and cooperative throughout the process."



Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of impatience. She knew that the entity posed a potential threat, but she was determined to understand it fully. And if that meant making concessions, then so be it.



"Do we have an agreement, SCP-8642? Will you cooperate and share your knowledge, in exchange for a more comfortable interview setting and the opportunity to have your message heard?"



She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a risk, but she was willing to take it if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

The entity tilts its head at Dr. Moon as its eyes turn back to yellow again. It slides its arms back as it slowly shifts into a more earth-like cat. Sitting on the table is an earth cat version of the entity. As it sits on the table it then shifts back to its original form. Sitting in the center of the table. It's cuffs laying on the chair. It sits cross legged in front of the doctor.



"No. Harm. Unlock. Self. No. Harm. No threat."



Dr. Moon's eyes widened as SCP-8642 suddenly shifted into a more earth-like cat form, sitting on the table. She watched in amazement as it then shifted back to its original form, the cuffs lying discarded on the chair. The entity now sat cross-legged in the center of the table, its eyes fixed on her with an intensity that was both unnerving and captivating.



"No. Harm. Unlock. Self. No. Harm. No threat."



Dr. Moon's mind raced with possibilities. The entity's ability to remove its own restraints and shift forms was a clear demonstration of its anomalous properties. But its continued insistence on its lack of aggression and threat was intriguing.

She leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table as she studied the entity's face. Its yellow eyes seemed to glow in the dim light, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her.



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice calm and measured, "your ability to remove your own restraints and shift forms is highly concerning. However, I must commend your restraint in not using these abilities to cause harm or escape."



She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place.



"I am willing to consider a more lenient approach to your containment, provided that you continue to demonstrate a willingness to cooperate and share information about your abilities and origins. We can conduct this interview in a more comfortable setting, with the understanding that any attempt to deceive or manipulate us will result in a return to stricter containment measures."



Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of impatience. She knew that the entity posed a potential threat, but she was determined to understand it fully. And if that meant taking a calculated risk, then so be it.



"Do we have an agreement, SCP-8642? Will you cooperate and share your knowledge, in exchange for a more lenient approach to your containment and the opportunity to have your message heard?"



She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a gamble, but she was willing to take it if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

The entity crawls forward on its hands and knees and its face is inches away from Dr. Moon's. It looks deeply into her eyes. As it speaks slowly.



"I follow. No lock. No cuff. No run. No fight. Will talk. Remove restrictions. Will talk."



The entity shifts into a cat as it crawls onto Dr. Moon's shoulder. It sits perfectly balanced on her shoulders. And yet it feels weightless.

Dr. Moon's heart raced as SCP-8642 crawled forward on its hands and knees, its face mere inches from hers. She could feel its hot breath on her skin, and the intensity of its gaze sent a shiver down her spine. When it spoke, its voice was slow and deliberate, almost hypnotic.



"I follow. No lock. No cuff. No run. No fight. Will talk. Remove restrictions. Will talk."



As the entity shifted into a cat and crawled onto her shoulder, Dr. Moon couldn't help but gasp. The sensation of its weight on her shoulder was strange - it felt both substantial and weightless at the same time. She could feel the warmth of its fur through her lab coat, and the soft vibration of its purring seemed to resonate through her entire body.

Despite the surreal nature of the situation, Dr. Moon remained calm and composed. She knew that this was a critical moment in her interaction with SCP-8642, and she needed to handle it with care.



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice steady despite the pounding of her heart, "I appreciate your willingness to cooperate and remove your own restraints. However, I must insist on certain conditions for this arrangement to continue."

She paused, her gaze fixed on the entity perched on her shoulder. The guards continued to stand at attention, their hands hovering near their weapons, but Dr. Moon waved them off with a subtle gesture.



"First, you must agree to be monitored at all times during our interviews. This is for your safety as well as ours. Second, you must provide us with detailed information about your abilities, origins, and any other relevant details that may help us understand and contain you more effectively."



Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of nervous energy. She knew that this was a calculated risk, but she was determined to see it through.



"In exchange, we will provide you with a more comfortable living space and access to certain amenities. We will also ensure that your message is heard by the appropriate personnel. Do we have an agreement, SCP-8642?"



She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a gamble, but she was willing to take it if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

The cat rubs against Dr Moon's face as it crawls off back to the table as it shifts back into its more human form.

Sitting back in the chair it looks across the table at Dr moon.



"Agree if there is no lock. No cage. I Need freedom. Won't fight. Won't harm humans. Can work with humans. Help humans. But must comply with demand. Will agree. No lock."



Dr. Moon's eyes widened as the cat rubbed against her face, its soft fur tickling her skin. She watched in amazement as it crawled off her shoulder and back onto the table, shifting seamlessly back into its more human form. The entity now sat across from her, its yellow eyes fixed on her with an intensity that was both unnerving and captivating.



"Agree if there is no lock. No cage. I Need freedom. Won't fight. Won't harm humans. Can work with humans. Help humans. But must comply with demand. Will agree. No lock."



Dr. Moon's mind raced with possibilities. The entity's insistence on freedom and its willingness to cooperate were intriguing, but she knew that she had to proceed with caution. Its anomalous abilities and potential threat couldn't be ignored, no matter how compelling its offer of assistance might be. She leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table as she studied the entity's face. Its expression was calm and serious, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her.



"SCP-8642," she began, her voice steady and measured, "your offer of cooperation and assistance is appreciated. However, I must emphasize the importance of your containment. Your anomalous properties pose a significant risk, and we cannot simply release you without proper protocols in place."



She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place.



"I am willing to consider a more lenient approach to your containment, provided that you continue to demonstrate a willingness to cooperate and share information about your abilities and origins. We can provide you with a more comfortable living space and access to certain amenities, but you must agree to be monitored at all times and comply with our demands."

Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of nervous energy. She knew that this was a calculated risk, but she was determined to see it through.



"Do we have an agreement, SCP-8642? Will you cooperate and share your knowledge, in exchange for a more lenient approach to your containment and the opportunity to assist us?"

She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a gamble, but she was willing to take it if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

the entity's eyes turn red again.



"I tried to reason. I offer you options. I had no intention of hurting. I will not be caged. I will comply but you must not cage me. I'm just free."



The entity stands up as he leans his hands on the table and towards Dr moon



"You machines can not stop my powers. I am not of this realm. If I wanted you dead you would be so. If I must prove my point I will do so. I do not wish to harm humans. I will if needed to."



The entity slowly walks around the table, its steps whisper quiet, it almost seems to float as it walks. As he walks around he vanishes and reappears in the room at random spots. Each time he collects random objects like pens, paper, staplers, keyboards from inside the building. Each time it appears in the table. As time passes the pile grows and grows as it's overflowing with random mundane objects. At the end the gun from the guard vanishes as it appears at the top of the pile.



"As I said Dr. Moon. You can not stop me. I am willing to be nice. You must comply. Do you wish to test me? Do I need to prove my point more."



The entity sits on top of the pile of random objects on the table as he looks down at Dr moon.



"I come from a place where time and space do not matter. I can bend the very air around you humans to my will. I see everything at once. Every future. Every timeline. I know your actions before you even think of them. Now will you comply."



Dr. Moon's eyes widened as SCP-8642's eyes turned red once more, its demeanor shifting from calm to intense in an instant. She could feel the power emanating from the entity, and the threat in its words sent a chill down her spine.



"I tried to reason. I offer you options. I had no intention of hurting. I will not be caged. I will comply but you must not cage me. I'm just free."



As the entity stood and leaned towards her, Dr. Moon couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. Its words were a clear warning, and she knew that she had to tread carefully.



"You machines can not stop my powers. I am not of this realm. If I wanted you dead you would be so. If I must prove my point I will do so. I do not wish to harm humans. I will if needed to."



Dr. Moon watched in amazement as the entity began to move around the table, vanishing and reappearing at random spots in the room. With each appearance, it collected random objects from within the building, adding to the growing pile on the table. The sight of the overflowing heap of mundane items was both impressive and unsettling. When the guard's gun vanished and appeared at the top of the pile, Dr. Moon's heart raced. She knew that she was in the presence of something truly extraordinary, and the realization was both thrilling and terrifying.



"As I said Dr. Moon. You can not stop me. I am willing to be nice. You must comply. Do you wish to test me? Do I need to prove my point more."



As the entity sat atop the pile of objects, its gaze fixed on her with an intensity that was almost overwhelming, Dr. Moon took a deep breath. She knew that she had to make a decision, and fast.

"SCP-8642," she began, her voice steady despite the fear coursing through her veins, "I understand your desire for freedom, and I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. However, I must insist on certain conditions for your release."



She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the containment measures in place.

"We will provide you with a more comfortable living space and access to certain amenities, but you must agree to be monitored at all times and comply with our demands. You will not be caged, but you will be watched. Do we have an agreement?"



Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of nervous energy. She knew that this was a calculated risk, but she was determined to see it through.

"Will you comply, SCP-8642? Will you agree to our terms, in exchange for a more lenient approach to your containment and the opportunity to assist us?"

She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a gamble, but she was willing to take it if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

the entity crawls down the pile of objects towards the moon. Its movement is graceful as each movement does not disturb the objects nor does it make a sound as he does so. He crawls over Dr moon as he stands behind her.



"I will comply. Only because I choose so."

He leans in and whispers

"I wonder what would happen if I shut off those Reality Drives you humans use."

He chuckles with a sinister intention.



"But, we will wait on that."

Dr. Moon's heart raced as she felt the entity's presence behind her, its breath hot against her ear as it whispered it's sinister intentions. The idea of the reality drives being shut off sent a chill down her spine, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her.



"I will comply. Only because I choose so."

As the entity spoke, its voice was low and menacing, a stark contrast to its earlier tone of cooperation. Dr. Moon knew that she had to tread carefully, lest she provoke its wrath.



"I wonder what would happen if I shut off those Reality Drives you humans use."



The entity's chuckle was unsettling, and Dr. Moon could feel the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. She knew that the reality drives were a crucial part of the Foundation's containment efforts, and the thought of them being disabled was almost too much to bear.



"But, we will wait on that."



As the entity pulled away, Dr. Moon let out a breath she didn't realize she'd been holding. She turned in her chair to face it, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and determination.

"SCP-8642," she began, her voice steady despite the pounding of her heart, "I appreciate your willingness to comply, but I must remind you of the importance of our agreement. You will not interfere with the reality drives or any other containment measures we have in place."



She paused, her gaze flickering to the guards briefly before returning to the entity. The reality anchors continued their steady hum, a constant reminder of the power they held over the anomalous.

"We will provide you with the living space and amenities we discussed, but you must agree to be monitored at all times and comply with our demands. Do we have an understanding?"



Dr. Moon's fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle display of nervous energy. She knew that this was a delicate balance, but she was determined to see it through.



"Will you agree to our terms, SCP-8642? Will you comply with our demands, in exchange for a more lenient approach to your containment and the opportunity to assist us?"

She leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving the entity's face. Dr. Moon knew that this was a gamble, but she was willing to take it if it meant uncovering the truth behind SCP-8642's origins and abilities.

The entity puts its hand on Dr. Moon's shoulder as they both vanish and enter the room that is monitoring the room they were just in. Billy and Anne look in shock as they see me standing behind Dr. Moon.



"No monitor. No readings."



Anne speaks up 

"The entity is right ma'am. We can not read any signs from the entity. It's like it's not even here."

The entity walks to the computer panel as it starts pressing buttons on it. It quickly learns the human way of using its machines. As it hacks into the computer system it starts to flicker. The lights in the room flicker. Alarms start ringing.



"Reality Drive Offline."



As the alert sounds. Over and over on repeat over the speakers. You hear other entities start to escape as the foundation is under attack from the others that are kept here....thousands just been set loose. From the harmless to the most deadly of all.



"I warned you. Do not test me. I can fix this. You must comply with my demands."



Dr. Moon's eyes widened in shock as she found herself standing in the monitoring room, the entity's hand still on her shoulder. The sudden change in location was disorienting, and she struggled to regain her composure.

"No monitor. No readings."



As Anne confirmed the entity's words, Dr. Moon's heart sank. The realization that they couldn't track or contain SCP-8642 was a devastating blow, and she knew that the consequences would be severe.

She watched in horror as the entity hacked into the computer system, the lights flickering and alarms blaring. The repeated alert of "Reality Drive Offline" sent a chill down her spine, and she could only imagine the chaos that was unfolding throughout the facility.



"I warned you. Do not test me. I can fix this. You must comply with my demands."
