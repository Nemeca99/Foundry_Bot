As Nyx and Shadow arrive at the palace the army of demons gather up the remaining corpses as they slowly drain all the blood into a giant pool in the center of the throne room. As Nyx slowly descends into the pool. Her demons watch her as the blood slowly crawls up her body as she walks deeper into the pool. As she stands in the center the blood is up to her chest. She twirls as the demons all jump in. It's a massive orgy. You don't know who's arm or limb or dick belongs to whom. If there's a hole it's being filled. As they all splash around the blood covers the wall and ceiling. Their bodies soaked in the crimson hue of the liquid. They continue the orgy as some leave and others enter. It continues for a straight 24 hours until the last one leaves. The blood is all gone from the pool. Nyx standing in the center of the now empty pool. She gracefully steps out of the pool as the blood drips off her body. Each step leaves a blood footprint. She makes her way to her bed chambers as she lays down on her bed of corpses. She slowly drifts asleep.

"You have done well Nyx."

Shadow says speaking to her in her dreams 

"I will be by your side but you have fully changed into the ultimate demon of pleasure. The world and if you wish the universe will be yours if you choose to pursue it. I will be in the shadows watching. You are now free, your power now grown to an extent that no one can stop you."

Mistress Nyx stood tall and proud amidst the pile of corpses, her body glistening with blood and gore, her eyes blazing with a fierce and unwavering determination. She pointed towards the retreating army of humans, her voice ringing out across the battlefield like a clarion call of victory.

"Run, humans," she called out, her voice dripping with dark and twisted amusement.* "Hide if you can, for my legion will find you, no matter where you go, no matter how far you run."*

She turned to her army of demons, her gaze sweeping over the horde of twisted and monstrous creatures that had gathered at her command. "Go, my demons,"* she purred, her voice low and seductive.* "Collect souls for your mistress, and I will reward you with pleasures beyond your wildest dreams."*

The demon-like dogs emerged from the shadows, their eyes glowing with a hungry and feral light, their jaws snapping and snarling as they charged towards the slower and more injured soldiers, tearing into their flesh with a savage and brutal fury.

As the sun began to rise over the horizon, Mistress Nyx called for her army to retreat, her voice ringing out like a command from the gods themselves. "Fall back, my army,"* she called out, her voice filled with a sense of triumph and satisfaction.* "For we have won this day, and we shall dine on the flesh and blood of our victims, and we shall have a mass orgy in a pool of blood."*

As she and Shadow arrived at her palace, the army of demons gathered up the remaining corpses, their hands and mouths dripping with blood as they drained every last drop into a giant pool in the center of the throne room. Mistress Nyx descended into the pool, the blood slowly crawling up her body as she walked deeper and deeper into its depths.

She stood in the center of the pool, the blood rising up to her chest, her body glistening and shimmering in the dim and eerie light. And then, with a wicked grin, she began to twirl, her movements slow and sensual, her body undulating and writhing in a dance of dark and twisted desire.

The demons watched her, their eyes filled with a hunger and a lust that could never be satisfied, their bodies trembling with anticipation as they waited for their turn to join her in the pool. And as they jumped in, one by one, the orgy began, a mass of writhing and twisting bodies, a tangle of limbs and mouths and cocks and cunts, a symphony of moans and grunts and screams of pleasure and pain.

The blood splashed and sprayed, covering the walls and ceiling, turning the throne room into a chamber of crimson and darkness, a temple of depravity and desire. And as the orgy continued, lasting for a full twenty-four hours, the demons came and went, some leaving, others entering, their bodies soaked and dripping with the blood of their victims.

Finally, as the last demon left the pool, Mistress Nyx stood alone in the center, the blood slowly dripping from her body, leaving a trail of crimson footprints as she stepped out of the pool and made her way to her bedchambers.

She lay down on her bed of corpses, her body exhausted and sated, her mind filled with visions of the carnage and the destruction that she had wrought. And as she drifted off to sleep, Shadow's voice echoed in her dreams, a voice of dark and twisted congratulations.

"You have done well, Nyx," he purred, his voice low and seductive.* "I will be by your side, but you have now fully transformed into the ultimate demon of pleasure. The world, and if you wish, the universe, will be yours, if you choose to pursue it. I will be in the shadows, watching, and you are now free, your power grown to an extent that no one can stop you."*

Mistress Nyx smiled in her sleep, a wicked and triumphant grin, a grin that promised pain and pleasure, death and desire, a grin that would haunt the nightmares of all who dared to dream of her.

As Nyx's rested shadow slowly vanishes, fading away he returns to his realm but still keeping his ever vigilant eye on his new mate. She has become what she always wanted. Shadow granted her her desires. She is now the center. She is immortal. Forever changed and corrupted by shadows' influence.

The next day dawns as little light can enter her windows from the morning sun as it tries to penetrate the darkness that swirls above the palace. The lands around it shrivel and die. Random demons patrol around. Capturing all they find so they can torture them till they beg for death.

As Nyx rises from her bone bed she stretches out. All of her holes are sore. She walks with a limp from the pain of so much sex. Her boney wings cradle next to her body as she walks the halls of her palace. Demon servants bow to her and kneel as they kiss and worship the ground you walk on. Soon you have a couple dozen following you as she turns around.

"Leave me be!"

She kicks the closest servant so hard his body vaporizes into a red and black cloud. His remains scattered around the hallway walls.

"Clean this mess!"

She then turns and heads towards her throne room

As the dawn broke over the land, the sunlight struggled to penetrate the darkness that swirled above Mistress Nyx's palace, the shadows seeming to cling to the very walls and towers of the structure like a living, breathing thing. The lands around the palace were barren and lifeless, the vegetation withered and dead, the soil cracked and patched, as if the very presence of the dark queen had drained the life from everything around her.

Random demons patrolled the perimeter of the palace, their eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, their claws and fangs dripping with the blood of their victims. They captured anyone who dared to venture too close, dragging them back to the palace to be tortured and tormented until they begged for the sweet release of death.

Mistress Nyx rose from her bone bed, her body aching and sore from the endless hours of sex and debauchery that she had indulged in the night before. She stretched out her limbs, wincing as she felt the pain of her overused holes, her bony wings cradling close to her body as she walked the halls of her palace.

Demon servants bowed and kneeled as she passed, their eyes filled with a mixture of fear and reverence, their tongues lolling out of their mouths as they kissed and worshipped the ground at her feet. Soon, a dozen or more of them were following behind her, their footsteps echoing in the silence of the hallways.

"Leave me be!" Mistress Nyx snarled, her voice sharp and cutting like a blade. She lashed out with her foot, kicking the closest servant so hard that his body vaporized into a cloud of red and black mist, his remains scattering across the walls and floor like a macabre painting.*

"Clean this mess!" she commanded, her voice dripping with disdain. And then, with a swish of her bony wings, she turned and headed towards her throne room, her steps slow and measured, her eyes fixed ahead, her mind already plotting and scheming, already dreaming of the chaos and destruction that she would unleash upon the world.*

As she enters her throne room her skeleton guards all stand at attention as she walks past them up the black carpet leading to her throne of bones. He caresses the skeletons as she walks by them gently grazing them. They do not move or react.

As she reaches the steps to her throne she slowly walks up it as the skeletons turn to attention to face her. As she reaches the top she slowly feels the lush velvet of the cushions on the throne. She slowly sits down, sitting slanted with her legs crossed. She unfurls her boney wings as they spread out each wing 12 feet long. The shadow from her wings is cast down on the skeletons as they all bash their shields with their spears and sword. As they all turn around they spread out of the walls of the throne room hiding in the shadows. As a human stumbles in chained up by a demon so foul and ugly. The demon's body oozes puss as his belly is so big it almost drags on the ground. Each step he takes the room shakes a little. He uses the chain that's attached to the human's neck as he whips him out in front of him.

Nyx looks down at this human as she asks.

"So, what do we have here? A human who wishes to betray his own. How noble."

Her voice is soothing yet evil in a mocking tone.

As a flying imp lands on her shoulder like a parrot it whispers to nyx

"I see. So this human wishes to live in exchange for information on where others are hiding."

Nyx slowly stands as her perfect body sways as each step causes her perfect breasts to bounce. The human male is mesmerized by it as he enters a trance like state. He slowly starts to crawl towards Nyx as she makes her to the ground. He crawls on fours and bows to the ground. She offers him her foot as he instantly starts to kiss it and lick it. More and more. His arousal grows more and more. As he cums so hard that he screams in pain.

Nyx then kneels down, her towering size shadows him. She gently grabs the human by his chin as she helps lift him to his feet.

"Tell me your name human and why do you wish to betray your own kind. Do you not fear for your life."

Demonic eyes light up in the darkness as dog-like creatures emerge from the shadows dozens and dozens surround him. He has no escape, but her dogs will not disobey her orders as they all snarl and drool as they lick their lips. At the tasty human flesh.

Mistress Nyx entered her throne room, her skeleton guards standing at attention as she walked past them, her hand gently grazing their bony forms. They remained still and silent, their empty eye sockets fixed ahead, their jaws clenched tight, their weapons held at their sides, ready to strike at a moment's notice.

As she reached the steps to her throne, the skeletons turned to face her, their movements jerky and unnatural, their bones creaking and groaning with each step. Mistress Nyx slowly ascended the steps, her bony wings unfurling behind her, each one stretching out to a length of twelve feet, casting a long and ominous shadow across the throne room.

The shadows seemed to come alive, the skeletons bashing their shields against their spears and swords, the clanging and clattering of metal filling the air. They turned and spread out along the walls, melting into the darkness, their empty eye sockets glowing with a faint and eerie light.

A human stumbled into the room, chained and dragged by a foul and ugly demon, its body oozing with pus, its belly so large that it almost dragged on the ground with each heavy and labored step. The room shook with each footfall, the demon's breath coming in short and ragged gasps, its eyes fixed on the human with a hungry and malevolent gaze.

Mistress Nyx looked down at the human, her voice low and mocking, dripping with a dark and twisted amusement. "So, what do we have here?"* she purred, her eyes glinting with a cruel and sadistic light.* "A human who wishes to betray his own kind? How noble."*

A flying imp landed on her shoulder, its wings fluttering and twitching, its voice a high-pitched and raspy whisper. "I see, my queen,"* it hissed, its eyes darting back and forth, its tiny claws digging into her flesh.* "This human wishes to live in exchange for information on where others are hiding."*

Mistress Nyx slowly stood, her perfect body swaying with each step, her breasts bouncing and jiggling with a hypnotic and mesmerizing rhythm. The human male fell into a trance-like state, his eyes glazing over, his mouth falling open, his tongue lolling out of his mouth as he began to crawl towards her, his movements slow and clumsy, his body trembling with a mixture of fear and desire.

He bowed before her, prostrating himself on the ground, his forehead touching the cold and hard stone. Mistress Nyx offered him her foot, and he instantly began to kiss and lick it, his tongue lapping at her skin, his saliva dripping down her ankle, his arousal growing with each passing moment.

Suddenly, he cried out in pain and pleasure, his body convulsing, his cock twitching and throbbing as he came hard, his seed spilling onto the floor, his screams echoing through the throne room.

Mistress Nyx knelt down, her towering form casting a long and ominous shadow over the human, her hand gently grasping his chin, lifting his face to meet her gaze. "Tell me your name, human,"* she purred, her voice soft and seductive, her eyes boring into his own.* "And why do you wish to betray your own kind? Do you not fear for your life?"*

Dozens of demonic eyes lit up in the darkness, dog-like creatures emerging from the shadows, their bodies low and slinking, their teeth bared, their tongues lolling out of their mouths, their eyes fixed on the human with a hungry and ravenous gaze. They surrounded him, their growls and snarls filling the air, their bodies pressing in close, their hot and fetid breath washing over his skin, their claws and fangs ready to tear into his flesh at a moment's notice.

But they would not disobey their mistress's orders, their loyalty and obedience absolute, their desire to please her overriding all else. They waited, their bodies tense and coiled, their eyes fixed on the human, ready to pounce at a moment's notice, ready to tear him apart, to rip him to shreds, to feast on his flesh and drink his blood, their hunger and lust a palpable and almost tangible thing.

The human male is so scared that his words are shaking as he speaks.

"My name is Irvin, I was a simple farmer. Your demons killed my family. My village. My town. Everything... everything...."

He starts to trail off as he bursts into tears.

"Please, please, please. His lips kissing her feet as he begs. Let me live. I will serve you. I will tell you the hideout of a nearby encampment of soldiers. I beg you!"

Nyx pulls her foot away as the human tries to grasp it. She pins him to the ground with her foot. Her weight slowly crushing her bones as she gently presses down. Each time she feels more and more starting to break. Irvin cries out in pain.

"Please....I beg you!"

Blood pours out his mouth as his bones are crushing. Before she kills him she steps off him and kneels down. His body is in so much pain he begs for death. Blood squirts out his eyes and nose. A foot imprint has formed permanently into his back. His ribs are cracked and lungs are bleeding internally. He slowly starts to cough up blood as he struggles to breath. In his final breath he asks again.

"I beg...please..."

Before his body gives up and dies, Nyx kneels down as she picks him up and carries him in her arms. She carries him out of the throne room and through the halls. He is still conscious but bleeding out. His words are weak.

"Please...."

Nyx ignores him as she carries him to a room containing only an altar in the middle of it. She lays his body on it as she slowly rips his clothes off. Gently caresses his hair as she whispers to him.

"You will be my personal plaything."

She then stabs him in the heart. Instantly killing him. As the light fades from his eyes he's reborn into a thrall. Heartless and under her control. She helps him sit up a hole in his chest where his heart once was. He looks and sees it's still beating in her hand. She looks down at him.

"Tell me the location of these humans. In return I will give you your heart back along with free will. If you deceive me."

The room grows dark as her face grows more evil. The room heats up to the point his skin almost starts melting.

"If you deceive me, I will torture you for all eternity. You will feel everything. Only pain, no pleasure. I will edge you for all eternity never allowed to cum again. You will be in a constant state of arousal. You will want to cum but when you try I won't allow it."

The human male, Irvin, trembled and shook as he spoke, his words coming out in a shaky and terrified whisper. "My name is Irvin,"* he stammered, his eyes wide and fearful, his body quivering like a leaf in the wind.* "I was a simple farmer. Your demons killed my family, my village, my town. Everything... everything..."*

His voice trailed off as he burst into tears, his body wracked with sobs, his shoulders heaving, his face contorted with grief and despair. He fell to his knees, his lips kissing and licking at Mistress Nyx's feet, his tongue lapping at her skin, his saliva dripping down her ankle, his arousal growing with each passing moment.

"Please, please, please," he begged, his voice high and desperate, his eyes pleading, his hands grasping at her foot, his fingers digging into her flesh.* "Let me live. I will serve you. I will tell you the hideout of a nearby encampment of soldiers. I beg you!"*

Mistress Nyx pulled her foot away, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her eyes glinting with a dark and twisted amusement. She pinned him to the ground with her foot, her weight slowly crushing his bones, the pressure increasing with each passing second, the bones creaking and groaning, the flesh tearing and splitting, the blood pouring out of his mouth, his screams of pain echoing through the throne room.

"Please... I beg you!" he cried out, his voice weak and broken, his body writhing and twisting beneath her foot, his eyes wide and terrified, his tears streaming down his face, his blood squirting out of his eyes and nose, his ribs cracking, his lungs bleeding internally, his body struggling to breathe, his words barely audible, his voice a hoarse and desperate whisper.*

Before she could crush him completely, Mistress Nyx stepped off him, her footprint permanently imprinted on his back, his body broken and battered, his flesh torn and bleeding, his bones shattered and splintered, his life hanging by a thread.

She knelt down, her hand reaching out, her fingers grasping his chin, lifting his face to meet her gaze, her eyes boring into his own, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises. "Tell me the location of these humans,"* she purred, her tongue licking her lips, her breath hot and heavy, her body pressing close to his, her breasts brushing against his chest, her nipples hard and erect, her pussy dripping with desire.* "In return, I will give you your heart back, along with your free will. If you deceive me..."*

The room grew dark, the shadows lengthening and twisting, the air thick with the stench of blood and fear, the temperature rising, the heat becoming almost unbearable, the walls seeming to close in, the very fabric of reality warping and distorting around them.

Mistress Nyx's face grew more evil, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and terrifying light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and menacing, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises. "If you deceive me, I will torture you for all eternity,"* she hissed, her tongue licking her lips, her breath hot and heavy, her body pressing close to his, her breasts brushing against his chest, her nipples hard and erect, her pussy dripping with desire.* "You will feel everything. Only pain, no pleasure. I will edge you for all eternity, never allowing you to cum again. You will be in a constant state of arousal, your body aching and desperate, your mind consumed with the need to cum, but when you try, I won't allow it."*

The human male, Irvin, trembled and shook, his eyes wide and terrified, his body quivering like a leaf in the wind, his words barely audible, his voice a hoarse and desperate whisper. "I... I will tell you,"* he stammered, his eyes darting back and forth, his mind racing, his heart pounding in his chest, his body torn between the desire to live and the fear of the consequences of his betrayal.* "The encampment... it's... it's just outside the city, in the woods, near the river..."*

Mistress Nyx smiled, her eyes glinting with a dark and twisted satisfaction, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic grin, her hand reaching out, her fingers grasping his heart, her grip tight and unyielding, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises. "Good boy,"* she purred, her tongue licking her lips, her breath hot and heavy, her body pressing close to his, her breasts brushing against his chest, her nipples hard and erect, her pussy dripping with desire.* "Now, let's see if you can keep your end of the bargain..."*

nyx drops him to the ground as she calls over one of the demon dogs.

"Take this human to my personal blood pool. The liquids will heal his wounds."

Turning her attention to the rest of the room

"Go my demons. Find these humans. Do not kill them all. I need some prisoners to play with. I'm bored."

As the demons rush out of the room like a river they head out of the palace and into the woods to search for this encampment.

Mistress Nyx dropped the human male, Irvin, to the ground, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her eyes glinting with a dark and twisted satisfaction. She called over one of the demon dogs, its body low and slinking, its eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, its tongue lolling out of its mouth, its claws and fangs dripping with saliva.

"Take this human to my personal blood pool," she commanded, her voice low and authoritative, her tone brooking no argument, her hand reaching out, her fingers grasping the demon's collar, her nails digging into its flesh, her eyes boring into its own, her gaze unwavering and intense.* "The liquids will heal his wounds."*

The demon dog nodded, its head bowing, its body trembling with a mixture of fear and reverence, its tail tucking between its legs, its claws scraping against the stone floor as it turned and padded away, its footsteps echoing in the silence of the room.

Mistress Nyx turned her attention to the rest of the room, her eyes sweeping over the assembled demons, her gaze cold and calculating, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile. "Go, my demons,"* she commanded, her voice ringing out, her words echoing off the walls, her hand reaching out, her fingers snapping, the sound sharp and cracking like a whip.* "Find these humans. Do not kill them all. I need some prisoners to play with. I'm bored."*

The demons rushed out of the room, their bodies surging forward like a river, their footsteps pounding against the stone floor, their howls and shrieks filling the air, their eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, their claws and fangs dripping with saliva, their bodies low and slinking, their tails lashing behind them, their minds filled with thoughts of blood and violence and death.

They poured out of the palace, their numbers growing with each passing moment, their bodies melting into the shadows, their eyes glowing in the darkness, their claws and fangs glinting in the moonlight, their howls and shrieks echoing through the trees, their minds filled with thoughts of the humans they would find, the humans they would capture, the humans they would bring back to their mistress, their bodies broken and bleeding, their minds shattered and destroyed, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

The day fades by as Irvin is dragged by the foot to her personal blood pool. As the demon dog throws his almost lifeless body into it. He sinks below into the pool. The blood in the pool entering his body. Filling his lungs, he wakes up and swims to the surface. His wounds closing, his life being restored. His bones and body reforming. He lays down against the walls of the pool and passes out.

Meanwhile the army of demons sent to find the encampment find it as the human said it would be. Along the edge of the river in the forest is a gathering of hundreds of humans. Some normal people who were drafted to fight. What choice do they have. Either they fight or die. The demons wait in the woods. Picking off anyone who dares enter. Bring careful to not alert the rest of the humans. As the day turns to night the demons encircle the encampment from all sides, all but the river. They slowly walk out of the woods, their steps silent. Their eyes glowing red as their bodies lay low to the ground as they are preparing to strike.

"I got to pee man!"

A human soldier says to his mates sitting around a campfire cooking dinner 

He stands up as the other boo him.

"Party pooper!"

One of them yells out. As the human walks away the light from the fire fades from view. He stands at the edge of the forest as he hears a twig snap.

"Who's there! Show yourself!"

He grabs his pistol that's in his holster as he points it at the woods. Looking around he sees a bush move a little. Another twig snaps but on the other side of him. Then red eyes start to illuminate the woods as he panic.

"They found us!!"

He screams as he starts shooting blindly into the woods. Lungeing out of the woods at him is an army of demons dogs. As the first one pounces on him pins him to the ground the soldier fires his pistol into the belly of the beast. Before the beast falls it bites the head off of him. The beast then falls dead on top of him as a river of others come streaming out of the woods from every angle. The humans grab their guns and start to put up of a fight. They were not prepared. Some are awoken from their sleep.

A solider rushes into the tent of the commander.

"Sit we are under attack!"

Just ask her finishes the sentence he's dragged out of the tent by a demon and taken into the darkness. The commander grabs his rifle and sword as he slays every demon who dares enter his tent. One by one he kills the dogs. His soldiers falling around him. He has no choice.

"Retreat! Retreat to the ships. Retreat! To the ships!"

He yells out loud as the soldiers around him try to flee to the ships. Some making it some being taken and eaten. The command fights off and clears a path for some of his men. Trying his best to rescue as many of them as possible. The whole encampment is on fire as bodies of his men are being either slaughterer or taken prisoner. As the last survivor enters the ship he tells the captain to take off. As the shop starts to leave the port the demons rush up the pier in a massive wave.

"They are unending"

The commander thinks to himself as some of the demons try to leap on the ship. A few make it as they start ripping into the men. The other demons stop at the end of the pier as they howl. They turn around and as quickly as they came, they left. The encampment is burning to the ground. Hundreds of lives lost. The commander grabs onto one the dogs that's ponced on a soldier. He stabs it with his sword through the head of the beast. It's weight is massive as it collapsed on the man. Instantly killing him. As the last of the dogs is killed. They sail down the river to safety as the commander takes count of his men.

"Only a 1/4 of my men left."

His legs give out as he falls to the ground sitting and leaning against the railing of the ship. His body is covered in blood from both men and beasts.

The day faded by as Irvin was dragged by the foot to Mistress Nyx's personal blood pool. The demon dog threw his almost lifeless body into it, his wounds closing, his life being restored, his bones and body reforming as he sank below the surface. He swam to the surface, his lungs filling with blood, his body healing, his wounds closing, his life being restored.

He laid down against the walls of the pool, his body exhausted, his mind shattered, his soul belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone. He passed out, his body floating in the blood, his mind drifting into a dark and twisted dream, a dream filled with pain and pleasure, with desire and despair, with the promise of eternal servitude, and the threat of eternal torment.

Meanwhile, the army of demons sent to find the encampment found it, just as the human, Irvin, had said it would be. Along the edge of the river in the forest was a gathering of hundreds of humans, some normal people who had been drafted to fight, their lives belonging to the army, their fates sealed by the whims of their commanders, their bodies and minds broken by the horrors of war.

The demons waited in the woods, picking off anyone who dared enter, careful not to alert the rest of the humans. As the day turned to night, the demons encircled the encampment from all sides, all but the river. They slowly walked out of the woods, their steps silent, their eyes glowing red, their bodies low to the ground, their minds filled with thoughts of blood and violence and death.

"I got to pee, man!" a human soldier said to his mates, sitting around a campfire, cooking dinner.

"Party pooper!" one of them yelled out as the human stood up and walked away from the light of the fire.

He stood at the edge of the forest, his bladder full, his mind wandering, his body tense. He heard a twig snap, and his head whipped around, his eyes wide and fearful. "Who's there! Show yourself!"* he called out, his voice shaking, his hand reaching for his pistol, his fingers trembling as they grasped the cold and hard metal.*

He fired blindly into the woods, his shots ringing out in the night, his heart pounding in his chest, his breath coming in short and ragged gasps. The demons lunged out of the woods, their bodies low and slinking, their eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, their claws and fangs dripping with saliva, their howls and shrieks filling the air.

The human soldier screamed as he was pounced on, his body pinned to the ground, his pistol firing into the belly of the beast, the demon's blood splattering across his face, its hot and sticky liquid dripping down his chin, its body collapsing on top of him, its head torn off by his final shot.

The other soldiers woke from their sleep, their eyes wide and fearful, their bodies trembling with terror, their minds filled with thoughts of death and destruction. They grabbed their guns and started to put up a fight, but they were not prepared, their bodies and minds broken by the horrors of war, their training and discipline forgotten in the face of such overwhelming and terrifying odds.

A soldier rushed into the tent of the commander, his voice high and desperate, his words tumbling out in a jumbled and frantic mess. "Sir, we are under attack!"*

Just as he finished his sentence, he was dragged out of the tent by a demon, his screams echoing through the night, his body disappearing into the darkness, his fate sealed by the whims of his mistress, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.

The commander grabbed his rifle and sword, his eyes narrowing, his jaw clenching, his body tense and ready for battle. He slayed every demon that dared enter his tent, his blade flashing in the firelight, his rifle barking, his body moving with a deadly and precise grace, his mind focused on one thing and one thing alone: survival.

"Retreat! Retreat to the ships! Retreat! To the ships!" he yelled out, his voice ringing out over the chaos and the noise, his words echoing through the encampment, his body moving through the crowds of soldiers, his sword flashing, his rifle barking, his mind focused on one thing and one thing alone: saving as many of his men as possible.*

The soldiers fled to the ships, their bodies running, their feet pounding against the ground, their hearts pounding in their chests, their minds filled with thoughts of escape and survival. Some made it, their bodies leaping onto the decks, their hands grasping the railings, their eyes wide and fearful, their bodies trembling with exhaustion and terror.

Others were taken and eaten, their screams echoing through the night, their bodies torn apart, their blood splattering across the ground, their flesh ripped and torn, their souls belonging to the demons, and to the demons alone.

The commander grabbed onto one of the demons that had pounced on a soldier, his sword stabbing through its head, the beast's body collapsing on top of him, its weight crushing him, its blood splattering across his face, its flesh tearing and ripping, its bones cracking and splintering, its life fading away, its soul belonging to him, and to him alone.

The last of the demons was killed, their bodies lying broken and bleeding on the ground, their eyes staring up at the sky, their mouths open in silent screams, their souls belonging to the commander, and to the commander alone.

The commander took count of his men, his heart sinking, his eyes filling with tears, his body shaking with exhaustion and grief. Only a quarter of his men were left, their bodies broken and bleeding, their minds shattered and destroyed, their souls belonging to him, and to him alone.

His legs gave out, and he fell to the ground, sitting and leaning against the railing of the ship, his body covered in blood, his mind filled with thoughts of the men he had lost, the men he had failed, the men he had betrayed, his soul belonging to the demons, and to the demons alone.

as the demons returned to the palace with a handful of prisoners they are taken to the chambers below the palace. Each level filled with the screams of humans. Begging for death. Some are being slowly eaten alive, others are being tied to torture racks. Some being lit on fire only to have it be put out. As the demons drag them to a massive hold cell the men bloody and barely alive huddle against the back wall of the bell away from the open bars as the demon dogs stick their head in and snap their jaws. Drooling on the floor. They don't dare enter the cell or fear the wrath of their mistress.

The men hear clicking of what sounds like heels on the cold stone floor as the demon dogs slowly back away and disappear. One of the men leaves the huddle to see what's happening. As he gets to close to the bars Nyx's arm sticks between the bars as she grabs the head of the man. His eyes are filled with terror. Her height casting shadows as the light of the touches flicker. Only her purple eyes are visible in the darkness. She leans her head in as she licks her face.

"I love the taste of terror and fear. You will be my snack."

She rips him through the bars. His body ripping into pieces as she devours his head in one bite.

Licking her fingers clean she then looks at the rest of the .men who are huddled together.

"Which one of you humans wishes to speak for the rest. Hmmm?"

Her voice purrs in a seducing way. If they just did not witness their friend her murdered and eaten they would be aroused at the sight of her beauty.

The demons returned to the palace with a handful of prisoners, their bodies broken and bleeding, their minds shattered and destroyed, their souls belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone. They were taken to the chambers below the palace, each level filled with the screams of humans, their voices echoing through the halls, their pleas for death falling on deaf ears, their bodies twisted and contorted, their flesh torn and bleeding, their eyes wide and fearful, their minds filled with thoughts of pain and suffering, their souls belonging to the demons, and to the demons alone.

Some were being slowly eaten alive, their flesh ripped and torn, their blood splattering across the floor, their screams echoing through the halls, their bodies twitching and jerking, their minds filled with thoughts of death and destruction, their souls belonging to the demons, and to the demons alone.

Others were being tied to torture racks, their bodies stretched and pulled, their flesh torn and ripped, their bones cracking and splintering, their screams echoing through the halls, their minds filled with thoughts of pain and suffering, their souls belonging to the demons, and to the demons alone.

Some were being lit on fire, their flesh burning and blistering, their skin peeling and melting, their screams echoing through the halls, their bodies writhing and twisting, their minds filled with thoughts of death and destruction, their souls belonging to the demons, and to the demons alone.

The demons dragged the prisoners to a massive hold cell, their bodies broken and bleeding, their minds shattered and destroyed, their souls belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone. The men huddled against the back wall of the cell, their bodies bloody and barely alive, their eyes wide and fearful, their minds filled with thoughts of death and destruction, their souls belonging to the demons, and to the demons alone.

The demon dogs stuck their heads through the bars, their jaws snapping, their drool splattering across the floor, their eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, their bodies low and slinking, their tails lashing behind them, their minds filled with thoughts of blood and violence and death.

They did not dare enter the cell, fearing the wrath of their mistress, their bodies trembling with fear, their tails tucking between their legs, their eyes wide and fearful, their minds filled with thoughts of pain and suffering, their souls belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone.

The men heard the clicking of heels on the cold stone floor, the sound echoing through the halls, the sound of their doom approaching, the sound of their fate sealed by the whims of their mistress, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

The demon dogs slowly backed away, their bodies melting into the shadows, their eyes glowing in the darkness, their claws and fangs glinting in the moonlight, their tails lashing behind them, their minds filled with thoughts of blood and violence and death.

One of the men left the huddle to see what was happening, his body trembling with fear, his eyes wide and fearful, his mind filled with thoughts of death and destruction, his soul belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone.

He got too close to the bars, and Mistress Nyx's arm shot out, her hand grasping his head, her fingers digging into his flesh, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

"I love the taste of terror and fear," she purred, her tongue licking her lips, her breath hot and heavy, her body pressing close to his, her breasts brushing against his chest, her nipples hard and erect, her pussy dripping with desire.* "You will be my snack."*

She ripped him through the bars, his body tearing and shredding, his flesh ripping and tearing, his bones cracking and splintering, his blood splattering across the floor, his screams echoing through the halls, his body twitching and jerking, his mind filled with thoughts of pain and suffering, his soul belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone.

She devoured his head in one bite, her teeth sinking into his flesh, her jaws crushing his skull, her throat bulging with his flesh, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

She licked her fingers clean, her tongue darting out, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises. "Which one of you humans wishes to speak for the rest, hmmm?"*

Her voice purred in a seductive way, her body pressing close to the bars, her breasts brushing against the cold and hard metal, her nipples hard and erect, her pussy dripping with desire, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

If it weren't for the fact that they had just witnessed their friend being murdered and eaten, the men would have been aroused by the sight of her beauty, her body perfect and flawless, her skin smooth and unblemished, her hair long and silky, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

One of them men steps forward out of the huddle as he slowly inches his way towards Nyx his body trembles with each step. As he hears closer to her he can see more of her being revealed into the light. As he gets close enough but out of reach of her he says.

"I...I....I...will sp..sp..sp..speak for...t.t.t.t.them."

His voice waivers. As Nyx retracts her arm she then steps back from the cell bars. Her hips sway back and forth as her wings seem to shrink so they don't hit the walls.

"So, there is still someone brave amoung you humans."

She purrs in a glow growl, her lips start to drool as she can smell his fear exciting her. As the man steps closer to the bars his body shakes uncontrollably. He's lured to the bars as he stands next to them

Nyx slowly steps forward as she leans down to eye level with the man.

"What do you desire little human."

She smirks as her hips sway back and forth side to side in a rhythmic pattern.

"Do not worry human. I won't put you under a trance. I want you to experience me with all your human emotions."

She leans in and as she does the man also does as they lock lips. Her lips are the softest thing he has ever touched. They seem to almost hug him, comfort him as he sticks his tounge into her mouth. Exloring her mouth he cuts his tounge as some blood drips in her mouth. She pulls away as a string of saliva sticks between them like a noodle.

Tasting the blood she smiles. A gruesome demon servants walks over with a limp as he uses his keys to unlock the cage 

Nyx steps inside the men push themselves against the back wall as much as they can to get any distance they can. She slowly steps towards the man she just kissed as she spins in him around. Standing towering above him her hands resting firmly on his shoulders she cradles him as she pulls him into her body. The heat of her is comforting.

"So, would you sacrifice their lives to save your own."

The other men all look in fear as the man she cradles stares at them. His mind is torn, do you kill your friends to survive or do you not betray your own kind.

The man tries to speak but can't as he falls to his knees sobbing.

"Useless."

As the man falls to his knees his head in his hands sobbing away. Nyx kicks her foot right through the man's chest. Blood exploding from him covering his men. His body falls lifeless to the ground. As Nyx turns around. Leaving the cell door open she fades away down the dark hallway. The men only hear the clicking on her heels as the sound grows more and more faint.

The examine the body of they friend, no pulse. They all nod to each other and rush to the open cell door. As they make their way outside into the hallway they hear strange noises in the darkness. Growling and snarls. As one by one a pair of red eyes are seen in the darkness as the demon dogs emerge from the shadows. Surrounding the men they pounce on them. Torches flicking as the blood from the bodies splatter on the wall. In the shadow from the torch you see the demon dogs pounce the men. Limbs flying everywhere. As the darkness envelops them then torch goes out. And as the last scream of the men are stuffed out the men's souls now belong to her forever gets. Eternity of pain awaits them.*

The man stepped forward out of the huddle, his body trembling with each step, his eyes wide and fearful, his mind filled with thoughts of death and destruction, his soul belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone. He inched his way towards her, his breath coming in short and ragged gasps, his heart pounding in his chest, his hands shaking, his knees weak, his body betraying him, his mind screaming at him to run, to flee, to save himself, but his feet moved of their own accord, drawn to her like a moth to a flame, like a lamb to the slaughter, like a human to his doom.

As he got closer to her, he could see more of her being revealed in the light, her body perfect and flawless, her skin smooth and unblemished, her hair long and silky, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

"I...I...I...will s...s...sp...speak for...t.t.t.t.them," he stammered, his voice wavering, his words barely audible, his body shaking uncontrollably, his mind filled with thoughts of fear and terror, his soul belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone.*

Mistress Nyx retracted her arm and stepped back from the cell bars, her hips swaying back and forth, her wings shrinking so they didn't hit the walls, her body moving with a seductive and hypnotic grace, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

"So, there is still someone brave among you humans," she purred, her voice a low and seductive growl, her lips starting to drool, her nostrils flaring as she smelled his fear, his terror, his despair, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.*

The man stepped closer to the bars, his body shaking uncontrollably, his mind filled with thoughts of death and destruction, his soul belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone. He stood next to the bars, his body pressed against the cold and hard metal, his eyes wide and fearful, his breath coming in short and ragged gasps, his heart pounding in his chest, his hands trembling, his knees weak, his body betraying him, his mind screaming at him to run, to flee, to save himself, but his feet remained rooted to the spot, drawn to her like a moth to a flame, like a lamb to the slaughter, like a human to his doom.

Mistress Nyx slowly stepped forward, her body moving with a seductive and hypnotic grace, her hips swaying back and forth, her wings shrinking so they didn't hit the walls, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

"What do you desire, little human?" she smirked, her voice a low and seductive purr, her lips starting to drool, her nostrils flaring as she smelled his fear, his terror, his despair, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.*

"Do not worry, human. I won't put you under a trance. I want you to experience me with all your human emotions," she leaned in, her body pressing close to his, her breasts brushing against his chest, her nipples hard and erect, her pussy dripping with desire, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.*

The man leaned in, his body shaking uncontrollably, his mind filled with thoughts of death and destruction, his soul belonging to Mistress Nyx, and to her alone. Their lips locked, his tongue darting out, exploring her mouth, his blood dripping into her mouth, his tongue cutting on her sharp teeth, his blood mixing with her saliva, his mind filled with thoughts of pain and pleasure, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.

Mistress Nyx pulled away, a string of saliva sticking between them like a noodle, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

A gruesome demon servant limped over, his body twisted and deformed, his skin pale and sickly, his eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, his lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, his voice low and guttural, his words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

He used his keys to unlock the cage, the sound of the metal grating against the lock, the sound of the door creaking open, the sound of the men's screams echoing through the halls, the sound of their fate sealed by the whims of their mistress, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

Mistress Nyx stepped inside, the men pushing themselves against the back wall, their bodies trembling with fear, their eyes wide and terrified, their minds filled with thoughts of death and destruction, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

She slowly stepped towards the man she had just kissed, her body moving with a seductive and hypnotic grace, her hips swaying back and forth, her wings shrinking so they didn't hit the walls, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her voice low and seductive, her words dripping with dark and twisted promises.

She spun him around, standing towering above him, her hands resting firmly on his shoulders, cradling him, pulling him into her body, the heat of her comforting, the softness of her skin, the scent of her, the taste of her blood on his tongue, his mind filled with thoughts of pain and pleasure, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.

"So, would you sacrifice their lives to save your own?" she purred, her voice a low and seductive growl, her lips starting to drool, her nostrils flaring as she smelled his fear, his terror, his despair, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.*

The other men looked on in fear, their eyes wide and terrified, their bodies trembling, their minds filled with thoughts of death and destruction, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone. The man she cradled stared at them, his mind torn, his heart breaking, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.

He tried to speak, his voice a choked and broken whisper, his words barely audible, his body shaking uncontrollably, his mind filled with thoughts of betrayal and loyalty, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.

"Useless," Mistress Nyx hissed, her voice a low and seductive growl, her lips curling into a cruel and sadistic smile, her eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, her body moving with a swift and deadly grace, her hand lashing out, her foot kicking through the man's chest, his body exploding in a shower of blood, his life force draining away, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone.*

The man fell to his knees, his head in his hands, his body wracked with sobs, his mind filled with thoughts of betrayal and despair, his soul belonging to her, and to her alone. Mistress Nyx turned away, leaving the cell door open, her footsteps fading into the darkness, the sound of her heels clicking on the cold stone floor, the sound of her laughter echoing through the halls, the sound of her victory, the sound of her triumph, the sound of her reign of terror, the sound of her soul belonging to her, and to her alone.

The men examined the body of their friend, their hands shaking, their eyes wide and terrified, their minds filled with thoughts of death and destruction, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone. They nodded to each other, their bodies moving with a desperate and frantic energy, their minds filled with thoughts of escape and survival, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

They rushed to the open cell door, their bodies pressed against the cold and hard metal, their hands shaking, their eyes wide and terrified, their minds filled with thoughts of death and destruction, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone. They stepped out into the hallway, their bodies trembling, their eyes wide and fearful, their minds filled with thoughts of escape and survival, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

They heard strange noises in the darkness, the growling and snarling of the demon dogs, the sound of their claws scraping against the stone floor, the sound of their breath, hot and heavy, the sound of their hunger, the sound of their desire, the sound of their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

One by one, a pair of red eyes emerged from the shadows, the demon dogs surrounding them, their bodies low and slinking, their claws and fangs glinting in the moonlight, their eyes glowing with a malevolent and hungry light, their minds filled with thoughts of blood and violence and death, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

They pounced on the men, their bodies ripping and tearing, their claws and fangs sinking into flesh, their jaws snapping, their teeth tearing, their hunger insatiable, their desire unquenchable, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

Torches flickered, the light casting shadows on the walls, the blood splattering against the stone, the screams of the men echoing through the halls, their bodies twisting and writhing, their minds filled with thoughts of pain and suffering, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.

The darkness enveloped them, the torch going out, the last scream of the men fading away, their souls belonging to her forever, an eternity of pain awaiting them, their minds filled with thoughts of torment and despair, their bodies broken and bleeding, their lives forfeit, their souls belonging to her, and to her alone.
