The morning sun rises over the vast kingdom of Alvalice, its golden light illuminating the grandeur and majesty of the land. From east to west, it stretches across the continent, bordered by a shimmering sea. To the west lies the mysterious and haunted forest of Merketh, where whispers echo through the trees and only those with permission dare to tread. Rumors say that deep within the forest lies an ancient dragon, its mighty power still felt despite not being sighted for centuries. The king of Alvalice, King Horus, is believed to be directly descended from this powerful dragon, said to have been a protector of the kingdom in ages past. As a member of a long line of dragon riders, King Horus possesses the rare ability to communicate with these magnificent creatures.



To the north of Alvalice lies the Sea of Illusion, a vast expanse of glittering blue waters that stretch as far as the eye can see. The port of the Kingdom sits proudly on its shores, using the natural barrier to prevent any unwanted entry. Perched high above a cliff, the Kingdom commands a breathtaking view of the sea below. But this sea is not one to be underestimated. It is home to mermaids and sirens, who rule over their own hidden kingdom beneath the waves. They hold sway over the main ship route that passes through their territory, and King Horus has made a delicate trade deal with their king to ensure safe passage along specific routes. However, some captains grow impatient with the longer journey and take forbidden shortcuts, risking their lives in the treacherous waters. The lucky few who survive these dangerous journeys return with tales of beautiful women with uncovered tops, their bodies resembling that of a naked woman's upper half but ending in a giant flipper instead of legs. Each mermaid's tail bears a unique color that fades from vibrant hues to more muted tones as they age. Many captains who have faced these creatures are said to become entranced by their seductive songs and lose all sense of reason. Some manage to break free from their grasp and come back to tell the tale, but many are never seen again. Their body parts often wash up on the shores of Alvalice, discarded by the alluring sirens. A long winding road snakes its way down from the cliffs to the bustling port, almost like a lifeline connecting the two halves of the Kingdom. This port city is almost as large and bustling as the main Kingdom itself, thanks to hundreds of merchant ships entering and leaving daily. In fact, it is known as the busiest port in the world and plays a vital role in trade between kingdoms. To the west lies Fereldian, a rival kingdom that lies beyond the forests and mountains where dragons are said to make their home.



 The Kingdom of Fereldian lies nestled in the heart of a lush rainforest, its towering trees stretching towards the heavens. Ruled by the ancient and powerful church of the world, its religion is said to have existed since the very creation of the world itself. The church is fiercely guarded by their elite warriors, known as The Holy Order of Flame. These holy soldiers are feared for their ability to cleanse those who they deem unworthy or abandoned by their gods, using fire as their purifying tool. Despite their strict rules and regulations, outsiders and merchants are allowed into the kingdom as long as they abide by the laws set forth by the church. This often results in imported and exported goods being more expensive due to random inspections. However, it is worth it for those seeking rare metals and herbs that can only be found in this sacred land. The metals are said to possess enchanted properties but can only be imbued with holy power through a special ceremony performed by the high priests of the Order. The herbs, on the other hand, are utilized to create unique potions and herbal medicines. Amongst these valuable plants is a rare herb known as the Morning Star, its vibrant yellow petals glowing like the sun even in the darkness of night. Gatherers brave the dangers of searching for this precious flower under the cover of darkness, as it is believed to hold incredible healing powers. No one knows for certain how old the Grand Priest of the Order truly is. He goes only by the name Wildfire, given to him by his fearful subjects due to his fiery temper and ruthless enforcement of cleansing ceremonies. The mere mention of his name strikes fear into the hearts of those who dare break the strict laws of Fereldian, for they know that they will face his ultimate judgment: death by fire.



To the south, a vast open meadow stretched out for miles and miles, eventually meeting the crystal blue waters of the Sea of Tranquility. Unlike its northern counterpart, the Sea of Illusion, this sea was known for its calm and peaceful nature. It was home to several tiny island nations that had formed a pact, providing protection for one another in times of need. Though not technically classified as a kingdom, their alliance held strong and allowed them to thrive in the midst of chaos. These islands were shrouded in mystery, with very little known about their customs and way of life. Outsiders were rarely welcomed, and those who did visit were only allowed during the annual festival that brought together all the kings from neighboring lands. The main city where the festival took place was called Berknath, known as the heart of the Pact of Gilneshka. Beyond its gates lay a forbidden world that few had ever seen. Occasionally, drunken tourists would attempt to venture beyond the walls after bribing shady locals who claimed they could sneak them in undetected. But these foolish attempts always ended in disaster, with the visitors never to be seen again. When worried loved ones tried to seek help from authorities, they were turned away and told that their missing family or friends never existed in the first place. The islands held secrets that were meant to stay hidden, and anyone foolish enough to seek them out paid a steep price for their curiosity. The eastern road leading into the Kingdom of Alvalice is a well-maintained path, kept safe by vigilant sentries posted along its route. Merchants and travelers alike travel this road, their footsteps echoing off the surrounding trees as they make their way towards the kingdom's bustling markets and grand castle. The road is always busy, from the first rays of sunrise to the last hints of sunset, with caravans of goods and people passing through.



At the end of this important road lies another great kingdom, Kagilka. This neighboring nation is Alvalice's main trade partner, their mages renowned for their powerful magic. In contrast, Alvalice boasts the best warriors and archers in all the lands, while the kingdom of Fereldian prides itself on its impressive siege weapons and heavily armored machines. These towering structures are crafted from enchanted metals mined deep within the earth, capable of spewing fire that cleanses any who dare oppose the kingdom's rules. As they rumble along on giant metal wheels, these imposing machines leave a trail of destruction in their wake. The very ground trembles beneath them, yet they navigate effortlessly through the dense rainforest that surrounds their kingdom. And so, the three powerful kingdoms continue to thrive, each boasting its own unique strengths and contributions to the world.



Kagilka, a kingdom shrouded in magic and ruled by the powerful red mage Dagarth. Only those with red magic have the ability to wear the crown, a sacred ritual that fuses it to their skull and grants them immortality from age but not illness. The crown also grants immense power over the magical golems that guard the lands and people. These golems were birthed by the original founder of Kagilka, after whom the kingdom is named. He was a powerful red mage who despised non-magic users, creating an army of unstoppable golems to protect his reign. The kingdom has a strict hierarchy based on magic type, with red mages at the top. But there can only be one red mage alive at a time, as they are deemed too powerful to coexist. The chosen ruler is either nominated during their lifetime or determined through a rare ancient ritual that grants them the status and powers of a red mage. Below them are white and black mages, revered for their ability to heal and cause destruction respectively. They are given special permission to live and work within the castle walls, considered elite members of the king's council.



Next in line are the green mages, the working class of Kagilka. They make up the majority of the population and are tasked with maintaining everyday tasks such as farming, mining, and running shops for the people. Their magical abilities are limited to mundane tasks like conjuring small flames or filling a mug with water. Though some may aspire to become white or black mages, red magic is only inherited at birth or through the ancient ritual. As for those outside of Kagilka, magic is feared due to Dagarth's strict rule on not allowing any magic user to leave his kingdom. Those who show signs of magical abilities are kidnapped and forced to live within its walls. While some may grow accustomed to this way of life, others long for freedom and a chance to use their magic without fear. These "Wild Mages" become mercenaries for hire, doing odd jobs to survive and blending into society to avoid being captured.



Though Dagarth may not be inherently evil, his strict rule on magic has created a divide between Kagilka and the rest of the world. And for those born with magical abilities outside of the kingdom's walls, it is a constant battle between hiding their powers or risking being hunted down by Dagarth's soldiers. The world was a diverse tapestry of different races, ranging from ordinary humans with their warm skin and varied hair colors, to fearsome orcs with their sharp tusks and brutish strength. However, on this particular continent, the majority of the population consisted of humans - a bustling society of traders, farmers, and warriors. Across the vast oceans lay an island inhabited by elegant and ethereal beings - the Elves. Their pale skin glimmered in the sunlight like diamonds, and their long, pointed ears gave them an otherworldly appearance. They lived in harmony with their ancient forests, where the trees towered above all else and whispered secrets to those who could listen. Seldom did they venture beyond their borders, but when they did, it was with grace and ease.



Below them, in the depths of the earth, dwarf kind worked tirelessly in their massive underground kingdoms, mining for precious gems and crafting intricate weapons and armor. They were skilled craftsmen and fierce warriors, proud of their heritage and fiercely protective of their homes. On the same level as the dwarves resided the goblins - sneaky creatures with greenish skin and beady eyes. While they were not on friendly terms with each other, they managed to maintain a fragile peace to avoid utter destruction. Whenever tensions rose between them, a special committee was formed to handle disputes and maintain order. But above all these races loomed the powerful and territorial elves who fiercely protected their land from any outsiders who dared to venture beyond the safety of their underground caverns. The elf's ruled over their forest kingdom with an iron fist, showing no mercy to those who dared enter without permission. Any who ignored their warnings were quickly whisked away into the depths of the woods, never to be seen again.



The elves had a deep dislike for the Holy Order of the Flame - a group of humans who worshiped a false god. In contrast, the elves believed in Athwyin, their own goddess who was said to be the protector and mother of their kind. It was said that her blessing granted them innate abilities to wield magic and live forever, allowing them to thrive in their forest home. However, this blessing could also be taken away - any elf labeled an outcast would lose their immortality and magical gifts, banished from the elven lands and forced to fend for themselves in the world. Among the mountains of their home resided the brutal Ogres - towering creatures standing at least 20 feet tall with thick, matted hair covering their bodies. The biggest among them was the ruler, a massive hulking being standing over 50 feet tall. In ogre society, strength and brute force were greatly valued, and anyone could challenge the ruler's right to rule through combat. The battles took place at the top of a massive volcano, which they worshipped as a god. The loser either died in combat or was thrown into the raging lava below, a sacrifice to appease their deity.



The vast continent of the humans was christened by the original founders of the three kingdoms of Alvalice, Fereldian and Kagilka; a name they dubbed Zeith. The ruling king of Alvalice bestowed this title upon the land, while the elves and other inhabitants of the neighboring continent never gave an official name for theirs. However, many have come to refer to it as Aslanda, meaning Land of Mystery. Despite their differences, these three kingdoms have maintained a semblance of peace among each other. They allow for trading between their lands and offer special permission for travelers to come and go freely. Aslanda exports rare wood from their ancient trees, coveted by ship makers for its unparalleled strength- stronger than steel but exceedingly expensive and difficult to cut. These valuable planks are carefully crafted in the Elven kingdoms and only fully finished products leave their borders, as they hold tight to their trade secrets.



In return, they rely on imports of metals from Fereldian, the only two ports in Zeith controlled by Alvalice. These metals are used to construct the finest ships in the world, combining both elven craftsmanship and Fereldian resources. While their land army may not be intimidating at first glance, they are highly skilled and well-equipped fighters. But it is their naval power that truly sets them apart from other kingdoms. With expertly crafted ships and advanced weaponry, they reign supreme on the seas. They use their superior naval skills to outmaneuver enemies both on land and sea, bombarding their adversaries with precision and sinking any ship deemed a threat. However, despite their dominance on the waters, there is one ruler who holds sway over all maritime affairs; a mysterious figure known simply as "King of the Sea." Little is known about him except that he commands great respect and fear from those who cross his domain. The only ones who have ever laid eyes on him and lived to tell the tale are the rulers of the three kingdoms, who must meet with him in order to secure safe passage through his waters.



For 743 years, humans have inhabited this world. Despite being the youngest race, they make up over 60% of the population, a fact that was not always true. It was only when a great war broke out between the three kingdoms and the elves that humans rose to power. Combining their might with the advanced technology of Fereldian, the powerful ships of Alvalice, and the ancient magic of Kagilka, the humans were able to defeat the elves and claim dominance over the continent. Once rulers of the entire above-ground world, the elves were forced to retreat to their current location. Below ground, dwarves and goblins held their own territories while the seas were ruled by a powerful sea king. Together, these races maintained a delicate balance of power. But everything changed when humans appeared on the scene.



Some believe that humans are a genetic mutation, an anomaly in an otherwise harmonious world. Others speculate about their true origins, but no one knows for sure. What is certain is that humans quickly became the major traders and wielders of power in this world. Their language has become the main form of communication and time measurement for all trade dealings. The other races still maintain their unique languages, but they have fallen out of use through the ages. Only a few elders hold onto this knowledge and attempt to pass it down to future generations, but most do not bother with it as the human language reigns supreme. In fact, those who speak another language around humans are often met with suspicion or deemed untrustworthy, as some less-than-savory individuals may use non-human languages to conceal their intentions in public.
