As Avaria leads him and her horse to the stables the sun slowly sets on the Kingdom, but in the Kingdom of Kagilka its ruler Dargarth whom is sitting in his office. His advisors sit around him, all bearing the colors of the kingdom. One of the advisors speaks up, “Sir, we have heard rumors of a wild red mage that has been spotted outside of Avalice.”


Dagarth leans back in his chair, the plush velvet cushions his body. He is very young only around the age of 19, he is the youngest red mage who has existed, he was given this position due to his father’s mysterious passing. Last year around the 19th birthday of Dagarth his father signed away him to be his heir, a few days later his father vanished. The courts didn’t know what to do, the golems still protected the city as only the red mage ruler can do that. They knew since the golems where still active that he must be alive, a full year passed as his father never returned.


With that the advisors and members of his counsel all agreed to give the ritual to his son Dagarth.
