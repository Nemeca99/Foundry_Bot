In the prestigious schools of Mavlon, each race has their own unique version of the story about their shared world. The tale you are about to read follows a young human male named Zell. His story is a fascinating one, for he possessed a mind unlike any other of his kind. He saw the world with a different light, and his understanding and perception often set him apart from his peers. Zell's origins were shrouded in mystery, as he was raised on a farmstead in the sprawling meadows of Alvalice. These fields were not only known for their picturesque beauty, but also for providing essential resources to the kingdom - grains, meat, horses, and livestock. Zell's foster parents had been farming this land for generations, passing down their knowledge and skills through the ages. Their horses may not have been the most highly sought after in the kingdom, but they were strong, sturdy animals bred for power rather than speed. The rare horse that displayed qualities of both would fetch a high price, but Zell's family did not rely on these sales alone. Instead, they reserved their best horses to sell directly to the king and his men. It was a profitable business, and one that brought honor to their name and reputation in the kingdom.



Amidst the tranquil surroundings of their farm, Zell's 21st birthday was being celebrated by his doting parents. From a young age, they had recognized his thirst for adventure and ambition for more. Despite their best efforts to provide for him, they were not wealthy farmers and could only afford the bare necessities. As Zell sat at the handcrafted wooden table, it wobbled slightly as he shimmed another piece of wood under the leg to stabilize it. This simple yet functional table epitomized the way he lived - always finding solutions and making do with what he had. Blessed with an innate talent for both craftsmanship and intellect, Zell was seen as a prodigy by many. However, he always downplayed his abilities, a result of years of hiding his intelligence from bullies who teased him for teaching himself how to read and write. Instead of joining in on after-school games and chores, he would stay late studying in secret. It was during one particular year that he was fortunate enough to have a retired captain from the King's army as his teacher. Choosing a peaceful life away from battle, the former soldier now imparted his love for history onto young minds like Zell's. The boy would eagerly absorb every bit of information like a sponge, constantly peppering his teacher with questions that went beyond the understanding of other students.

The teacher observed as Zell endured daily torment from the same group of boys. They would hold him down and physically harm him, but Zell never backed down or showed fear. He stood strong and faced his bullies head on, even if it meant getting injured. This resilience was a double-edged sword for Zell - while it allowed him to face adversity, it also led to impulsive decisions with potentially serious consequences. His refusal to back down also stemmed from a desire to learn and adapt, but it often put him in dangerous situations. In this specific instance, despite being taunted and attacked by the bully, Zell remained calm and even smiled through the pain. When an opportunity presented itself, he used his quick thinking and physical abilities to turn the tables on his attackers, leaving them beaten and defeated. But this act of retaliation also highlighted Zell's inclination towards violence and his lack of control over it. As the dust settled and the bully cried out in pain with broken bones, Zell's victory was tinged with regret. He had once again demonstrated his strength and intelligence, but at what cost? Would he ever be able to find a non-violent solution to his problems or would violence always be his go-to response? These were the questions that troubled both the teacher and Zell himself as they locked eyes after the chaotic incident in the classroom.



Eventually, the teacher steps in and stops the fight, checking on the injured boys. "Both of you need to go to the medical ward right away," he instructs them. Then turning to Zell, he sternly scolds him. "And you, we will discuss your actions after school today." As Zell watches the two students who helped carry the injured boys out of the classroom, he smirks and takes a seat at his desk while his classmates clean up the mess caused by their fight. The rest of the school day passes without any major incidents. Zell's mind wanders as he ignores his schoolwork, wondering what the teacher has in store for him after school. When the final bell rings and students start to leave, Zell remains at his desk until he is alone with the teacher in the classroom. The teacher closes the door before speaking softly to Zell.



"You have a gift, Zell. There is something special inside of you," he says, placing a hand on Zell's shoulder. "The way you moved in that fight with those boys, the way you endured their attacks in order to study their movements - barbaric as they may have been - showed qualities that I rarely see in my students. In my years as a captain of the King's army, I have trained thousands of men, but few possess your natural talent." He steps away from Zell and walks slowly towards one of the desks, sitting down next to him. The young Zell in his teens was taken under this teacher's wing, receiving training and guidance to refine his fighting style. Unfortunately, Zell only had one year with him before he passed away from an illness. But even with just basic training, Zell has become a skilled fighter who can hold his own. In addition to his daily chores, he trains himself by pulling wagons used for the farm's horses to build his strength and running alongside the horses as they frolic in the open meadows. Years of hard work and dedication have led to this moment - Zell's 21st birthday. It is time for him to leave his foster parents' home and pursue a life outside the confines of the farm. He will go to the city of Alvalice to train with the King's army and join their ranks, bringing honor to his parents.



Zell's mother sets a rustic homemade cake on the table in front of him as his father takes a seat next to him. His mother sits at the opposite end and motions for Zell to join them. "Happy Birthday, Zell. Your father and I are so proud of you," she says with a smile. "While we both wish for you to stay with us, we know that there is something inside you, something that the world needs. You will be the one the world has been waiting for. You're brilliant and an excellent fighter, taught by the king's retired captain before his unfortunate passing from illness."



His father speaks up, cutting off his wife. "You have also been an excellent son. My wife and I have always treated you like our own blood." He stands up and signals for his wife to follow suit. They exchange looks and nod at each other. His father briefly leaves the room and returns with something wrapped in an old, dirty cloth. "We don't make enough for luxury items, but your mother and I have been saving since the day you started training with your teacher. We can see how much your mind craves more. So, we got you a birthday gift." As he slides the object across the table, Zell can hear metal clinking inside. He quickly unwraps the cloth to reveal a simple short sword.



"I know it isn't much, but it was all we could afford for you," his father says, looking at him expectantly.



Zell grabs the handle of the sword and lifts it into the air with his right hand. The weight is not perfect, but it feels well-made enough. It's a perfect starting weapon for someone like him. As he sets it back on the table and stands up, he walks slowly towards his father, tears filling both their eyes. They embrace in a big hug and Zell starts crying along with his father. "Thank you, father. Thank you, mother. I know how much you had to sacrifice to get this for me. You two are my parents, regardless of blood. I will take this sword and I will go to the city," Zell says with determination as he breaks the embrace. His mother joins her husband in holding him close.



Zell takes the sword once again into his hand, not having a place to store it when not in use. He just holds onto it tightly. His parents look at him with pride shining in their eyes. Zell takes the small cake, big enough for one person, and splits it three ways, giving a bite to each of them. They all eat together, and while the flavors are simple, it tastes good. After giving his parents one last hug and seeing their tears, Zell stands firm and proud as he steps towards the door. "I love you both. I will be back. I will bring riches and fame to our home." With a final look at them, he turns around and heads for the door. As he stands in the open doorway of his home, Zell takes a step outside like he has done thousands of times before, but this time, they may be his last steps at his childhood home. 



With a practiced ease, Zell unhooks one of the workhorses from its stable post and attaches an old, worn saddle to its back. The saddle has a convenient spot for his sword, even though it wasn’t meant for it. He climbs onto the horse and clicks his heels against its sides as he takes hold of the reins. Trotting past his childhood home and seeing his tearful parents in the window, Zell nods to them before picking up speed on the horse. Despite being a workhorse, this one has experience and endurance, allowing Zell to gallop out of his parents' land and into an open meadow with flowers in full bloom. The afternoon sun warms him as he looks ahead at the high walls of Alvalice in the distance, realizing that this is the farthest he has ever been from home.



As time passes and the initial thrill fades, homesickness sets in for Zell. However, he is determined to keep going - this is what he wanted. He remembers all the sacrifices his parents made to afford even a basic sword for him and realizes they were right about him being different from others. All he knows is that there is a drive inside him, pushing him forward like some invisible force that has always been guiding him since birth. As the sun begins to set and Zell is still a day's ride away from the city, he starts to feel hungry. Having left in such a hurry, he didn't bring any extra supplies with him. He scans the open meadow for a place to make camp but finds no trees or shelter in sight. The only animals around are small prey like rabbits and foxes, which he wouldn't be able to catch with just a small sword and an old workhorse. Realizing that his horse needs water and food too, Zell continues on his journey. But soon enough, exhaustion catches up to him and he starts to doze off on the horse's back. His grip on the reins loosens and he nearly falls off but quickly regains his balance and continues onward. The chill of the night air sends a shiver down his spine as he finally reaches the city walls, grateful to have made it through the night.



The moon shone brightly in the night sky, casting a silvery glow over the meadows. Moon Flowers were scattered throughout, their dim white light adding to the mystical atmosphere. It was said that those who encountered these flowers on a moonlit night were blessed with good fortune on their journey. Zell, however, did not believe in such superstitions. As his horse slowly trots through the field of flowers, Zell can't help but admire the beauty around him. The ground is illuminated by the soft light of the Moon Flowers, and it's a breathtaking sight even for someone who doesn't believe in luck. Lost in thought about his upcoming trip to the city, Zell tries to distract himself from his hunger and lack of supplies.



Suddenly, he hears a faint singing sound and his ears perk up. He stops his horse and closes his eyes, focusing on the direction of the sound. It seems to be coming from ahead of him, so he urges his horse forward. As he gets closer, he sees a young girl sitting in the field with her horse grazing next to her. Intrigued, he observes her from a distance. The girl has long black hair that shines under the light of the Moon Flowers. Her voice is soothing as she sings, and her attention is focused on weaving together a wreath with the flowers. She stops when she hears Zell's horse approaching and turns to face him.



Zell stays mounted on his horse but prepares for any danger by placing his hand on his sword handle. The girl stands up and brushes off her simple white robe, revealing a pair of daggers attached to her belt. Her hunting bow and arrows are also nearby on her horse. She speaks cautiously to Zell, asking who he is as she reaches behind her back to grip her hidden weapons. Zell remains calm and maintains a distance from her while taking in her appearance under the moonlight. She is a human around his age, with long black hair tied together with Moonflower ties. Despite the potential threat, Zell can't help but notice her beauty and the fact that she is around his height. Leaving his sword still in the saddle of his horse, Zell dismounts and stands with his arms at his side. He has been trained in hand-to-hand combat by his teacher, and he is ready to defend himself if needed.



“I'm Zell, son of horse farmers from the kingdom. I'm headed to the city to make a name for myself.” His words were well-spoken and rehearsed, but they elicited a small giggle from the girl in front of him. Startled by her reaction, he drops his guard as she does the same. Her hands release the daggers she had been hiding behind her back, and she brings them to her front, clasping them together before giving a small bow. Zell can't help but notice how her black hair falls over her shoulder as she straightens up again.



“I'm Avaria, daughter of the chief of the Huntsman Clan in these meadows.” She smiles at Zell with soft lips, causing his heart to beat faster and his palms to sweat. As he wipes them on his pants, she can see his nervousness. Bringing her hand to her mouth to hide her amusement, she speaks again.



“Well then, Zell, the horse farmer. I wish you luck on your journey and success in the city.” She bows once more, letting her hair fall over her shoulder before brushing it away again. Picking up the wreath she had been working on, she sits back down on the ground and resumes her work while humming a joyful tune. Meanwhile, Zell stands there looking back at his horse and feeling his stomach growl. Clutching it in hunger, Avaria stops her work again but remains seated. Looking up at him with a grin, she comments, “For someone heading to the city, you don't seem very prepared for the journey ahead.” She gestures towards the direction of the city, its walls barely visible in the darkness with torches lining its top like a beacon for weary travelers.



“Actually, I have some leftover food from today's hunt if you'd like it.” She points towards her horse who is lying down and still chewing on some flowers. Next to the horse is her pack, and she stands up and brushes off the grass and dirt before heading to it. Bending over, she rummages through her pack and pulls out some dried meats wrapped in leaves and twine. Tossing it to Zell, she sits back against her horse who neighs but remains lying down and continues working on her wreath.



Zell quickly catches the food and wastes no time in devouring it. Avaria watches him with a hint of disgust mixed with amusement. “My, you must be famished.” She pauses for a moment to point to her flask of water. “I'm sure you and your horse are thirsty.” Zell carefully approaches her, avoiding stepping on the circle of flowers that Avaria had picked around herself while sitting. Kneeling down, he takes the flask from her hand and brings it to his lips. The cool water soothes his parched tongue and throat. He saves some for his horse and walks over to it as it lies down, its old body not used to such long journeys. Carefully pouring water into its mouth, Zell tries to give it enough to make it through the night. He shakes the flask to show that it's empty before returning it to Avaria.



She gestures for him to take a seat, saying, "Come sit with me. I'm making a Moon Flower wreath for my sick grandmother in the city. Unfortunately, her age is catching up to her and she won't be with us for much longer." As Zell settles into his seat, he listens to her words which have a soothing effect on him. Her confident tone instills a sense of calmness within him.



She hands him a few flowers that weren't suitable for the wreath and their hands brush against each other. He notices how soft her skin feels, and her smile emanates warmth and comfort, almost like a mother's love. The moonlight shines down on one of the flowers, casting a dim white glow on Zell's face as he takes a sniff. The scent is sweet yet earthy, with a hint of something unfamiliar. She watches as he examines the flower closely.



"These are Moon Flowers," she explains, "they are believed to bring good luck to travelers who see them when the moon is bright in the sky. That's why I'm here, making this wreath for my grandmother in hopes that it will aid in her recovery." She goes back to working on the wreath, occasionally placing it on her head to check its size. Zell observes her skilled hands carefully weaving the stems together with just enough force to bend them without breaking.



"My grandmother taught me how to weave these flowers," she continues, "they require delicate touch, or they will break." Zell tries to mimic her movements but ends up snapping the stems with too much pressure. Frustrated, he picks two more flowers and attempts again, but with the same result. She giggles once more and kneels down next to him, guiding his fingers with hers to twist the stems together gently. Her gaze fixed on his hands as he studies each movement needed to successfully twist the stems without breaking them.



Handing him a string of flowers, she encourages him to try again. Her joyful expression and motherly aura make Zell feel like a child learning from his mother. He picks a few more flowers but ends up breaking them all in the process. His face turns red with embarrassment and annoyance as he hates failing. She calmly picks up the broken stems and holds the flower to the sky, blowing softly on it and causing its seeds to scatter into the air like twinkling stars under the moonlight.



Zell watches in awe as he whispers, "Beautiful."



She giggles once again, "Yes, it truly is. It's rare for the moon to be so bright that it causes the flowers to glow like this." 



As he looks back at her, she already has made a small clump of flowers with their stems perfectly twisted together, as she leans close to him, his heart beating faster as he feels thumping it in his throat, as her hand comes near his face as he gulps. Closing his eyes he feels her soft hand run alongside his head, tucking his short brown hair behind his ear, as she sticks the flower bundle behind his ear. She leans back to see his eyes closed and lips puckered, she can’t help but giggle again at the face he is making. “Open them silly.” As he does, she points to the flower bundle she stuck behind his ear with a slight giggle as she covers her mouth with her hand. “This will bring you luck tomorrow.” she says before moving back against her horse again to work on the wreath some more. 



“So, what’s the city like?” Zell asks Avaria, his words and eyes filled with curiosity. She continues to work on her wreath for her grandma as she speaks to him. “I am not sure really; tomorrow will be the first time I ever went past the gates. I was never allowed to go in past the gates as my father forbids it for any of those not given permission to from the Huntsman Elder. But because my father is a busy person, he can’t go to the city to check on my grandmother. So, he sent me, he wasn’t happy, but he understood why I wanted to go.” 



Zell leaning forward sitting on the ground with his legs crossed under him as he turns to face her, his hands picking at the flowers idly. “Why wouldn’t he let you go inside, past the front gate?” His eyes meet her hands as he watches them carefully, as she speaks, he mimics her movements trying to tie the flowers together.



“He said it was too dangerous for me to go alone. But I am the best hunter in the clan, I can take care of myself.” Her words almost turn to anger, “I understand he wants to protect me, but just because I am a woman he thinks I’m a moonflower.” as she says that Zell’s attempt causing the stem to break. “Like a moon flower.” Zell whispers staring at the broken stems in his hands. 



She nods sighing pausing her work momentarily on the wreath, “My father just cares for his little girl, but he needs to learn that his little girl isn’t little anymore, she’s grown up.” her words turn back to calm as she goes back to work on the wreath. “I need to head to the hospital in Alvalice that’s where she is, then back home. Those were my orders from my father, I wanted to explore the city, but he wouldn’t let me.” sighing again her eyes and smirk turn to a playful smirk as she pulls out a small bag of coins from under her pack next to her. “I saved up some gold, I’m going to buy myself something. I am a woman after all, I deserve something nice every now and then.” sliding the pouch of coins back under her pouch going back to her work on the wreath her head moves from side to side almost in a mocking way as she speaks about in inequality she has to endure.



“What are you going to buy Avaria?” Zell asks he still focuses on the flowers a small pile of broken ones have formed at his side from all the failed attempts. His focus mostly on the flowers in his hands, he won’t be defeated by a flower. “I mean what does a girl want?” his focus still on the flowers in his hands. She looks at him and giggles at the small pile that has formed at his side of broken flowers. “Well, I’m not sure yet. Maybe a nice outfit or new bow? I hear the food the is BEST in all the lands, famous chefs from all over set up shop in the city. Being the central trade hub of the continent and all. They get wealthy merchants who trade with the shops there as they use that wealth to spend on the food of these chefs.” her mouth starts to water as she talks about the food. “They have cakes taller than a horse! Exotic fruits and veggies from all over! The meat so cooked perfectly that it falls off the bones as you pick it up.” her thoughts lost with food that she doesn’t pay attention and snaps one of the stems. She looks down at it, the broken stem falls through her fingers landing softly on the ground as he chuckles to her, her face squeezes turning red, as she throws the broken flower at him softly hitting his face. 



“Meanie.” she pouts going back to her work on the wreath. Zell smirks as he twists two stems together, splitting barely. Holding it up, “I did it!” as she looks at it her eyes show a sign of approval and look a mother gives to a child who put their own shoes on. A small snap of the stem is heard as it breaks fully splitting up the center of the stem as both half’s fall to the ground in front of him, his face and arms still in the air his eyes slowly water as he grits his teeth, she can’t help but let out a hardy belly laugh as the look on his face is priceless. His jaw dropping, his eyes in shock, his face turning red with embarrassment more than anger. Ignoring her loud laughing he picks to more flowers working them together again, snapping. Wiping the tears from her eyes from laughing she looks at him her laughs slowly settling down as she regains her original composer “Thank you, I haven’t laughed like that in a while. I needed that.” setting the wreath down at her side in its finished state, Zell focused on the flowers in his hand still the pile even bigger now. The area around him baren of any flowers as he cleared of all Moon Flowers. Her eyes look with endearment as she crawls to him, taking his chin in her hand his eyes look up. Leaning closer she plants a gentle soft kiss on his cheek. “Thank you, I mean it.” she whispers pulling away. Turning away from him to grab some cloth from her pack to wrap the wreath up securely as she sets it carefully into her pack as to not damage the delicate flowers she just worked hard to put together.



Zell, out of flowers looks at the big pile of broken flowers next to him, their combined glow like a little light that illuminates the small area around the pile. Watches as she rolls her bedroll and blanket with practiced movements. Gently landing on the ground as she crawls over it to smooth out the rough spots, her horse lays its head down in the cool meadow made of flowers, rolling onto its side to sleep. His horse had at some point walked over to hers laying down next to hers as well their bodies cuddling together. Watching from his spot in the grass as she crawls under the tattered handmade blanket having moon flowers made of string woven into the blanket, her head rest against the belly of her horse. Closing her eyes her soft lips move to whisper words to Zell. “Goodnight Zell, thank you again for tonight.” her body relaxes as she pulls the blanket up her shoulders, falling fast asleep with ease. Zell watches her for a moment before standing up, his knees in pain from sitting crossed legged for too long, stretching his body hearing a few creaks from his joints before laying down a few feet from her on the cold ground, his back to her as he lays on his side. His hands under his head to form a makeshift pillow, the night breeze chills his bones as he shivers slightly. Avaria’s eyes opening slightly to see him shivering. She smiles warmly at him, standing up as she moves her bedroll next to him, his body scooches over on top of the bedroll his back still to her. Laying next him she lays on the ground but presses her back against his back, the tattered blanket barely covered her, now it barely covers them both. Slowly reaching her arm over his body pulling him closer, her lips move. “Do not be worried, I will keep us warm.” her words like a warm hug as his body warms from hers. 



His mind slows down, her warmth reminding him of home, when his mother would cradle him like this at night when he had a bad dream. As he drifts to sleep, thoughts of his mother and father fill his dreams. A small smile on his face.



In his dreams, Zell is transported back to his childhood home where he lived with his foster parents. He sees the familiar living room, where his mother would hold him when he was scared and his father would teach him the value of hard work. But suddenly, his happy memories twist into a nightmare as he sees his parents being taken away in a cage pulled by horses. The driver, a mysterious figure cloaked in black, ignores their cries for help as they are carried further and further away. Zell tries to run after them, but his legs can't keep up and he is left standing alone, crying for his lost family. As he watches from an outsider's perspective, he sees himself as a young child of 8 years old, then shrinking to 6, then 4, and finally to an infant crying helplessly. He desperately tries to communicate with his younger self, wanting to offer comfort and reassurance, but his words never leave his mouth.



The light around the infant shrinks until it is a mere flicker, as an overwhelming darkness creeps in from all sides. Zell desperately reaches for the infant, but his hands pass through its ethereal form. He refuses to give up, each time straining with all his might to make his arms tangible, but the void continues to engulf them both. Finally, the darkness overtakes the last remaining glimmer of light and swallows the infant whole. The sound of its cries pierces through the emptiness, taunting Zell as he struggles to stand up and follow its haunting wails. But no matter how fast he moves, the sound remains just out of reach, tormenting him with its constant presence. Each step feels like an eternity as he fights against the oppressive darkness that surrounds him. His throat burns with the effort of trying to call out, but no words escape his lips except for hoarse gasps. And then it happens - the crying intensifies until it consumes his entire being, drowning out all other thoughts and senses. He covers his ears in a futile attempt to block out the endless cacophony, but it only grows louder and more piercing. Desperate to escape this nightmare, he opens his mouth to scream for help - but even that basic function has been taken from him by the relentless grip of the darkness. As tears stream down his face, all he can do is surrender to the unending symphony of an infant's cries echoing in his mind, driving him closer and closer to madness.





Agonizing pain spreads through his body, his head pounding with each cry of the infant. His mind is a jumbled mess, unable to even form coherent thoughts as he begs for the agony to stop. Blood courses through his veins, burning and boiling as if it's ready to burst out of his body. He can feel himself changing, growing into something else as the crying continues to intensify. The pain on his face grows, his head feeling like it’s about to explode as the pressure increases. The crying infant gets louder and faster, his head throbs and pulses almost like as if it’s a heartbeat. The blood in his body with each pulse or beat of his heart burns like molten metal, the crying so loud now he can’t even form words in his head. Pressing hard against his head with his hands, begging for it to stop. As the baby cries more and more, his nose and eyes start to bleed the burning blood. His ears growing, changing, his body feels like it wants to burst. As the blood that’s coursing through his veins feels like it’s boiling, his head like a bomb about to go off, he endures the pain, fights back. The infant cries growing still intense, the blood boiling even more new wounds open across his body. The intensity of his pain was unlike anything he had ever felt before. Falling to his knees, his hands still grasping the sides of his head pressing into his skull trying to push back against the pressure he feels. Using what strength, he can find within himself, pushes himself on his feet. His legs feel like liquid, his chest hurts with every breath. The void it self-starts to spin around him, the infant cries somehow grow louder, more intense. His boiling blood finding any way to escape his body, even causing his skin to break open, as fresh wounds oozing from them, blood flows from his eyes down his face leaving a path of burning flesh that fills the air, his ears changing to match his body, his nose and mouth grows, his voice changing into something he’s never heard before. Wounds on his body open more and more, as a river of blood sprays out of him in all directions, spreading his arms out the void rescinds back, the light shines on him again as he watches his shadow grow and morph. His wounds open, his skin peels off landing on the ground around him, as his muscles under his skin start to harden into something else….



“Wake up!” Avaria is shaking him, she wakes up to him shaking violently in his sleep. “Wake up Zell!” he won’t awaken as his body still shakes. Moving away from him, crawling she reacts by reaching into her pack. “I was trying to save this. You owe me Zell.” she pulls out a spherical object covered in paper. With a tiny wick sticking from the top, she pulls out some flint and tinder igniting the wick. It slowly burns as it enters the object. She throws it high as she can up in the air as she kneels down to cover her ears with her hands. It explodes in a loud noise and light filling the night sky with light as strong as the sun. The sound so intense that Zell wakes up, Avaria unclenches herself to see he’s awake. His body covered in sweat as his breathing is very fast. She rushes to him setting his head in her lap, using a part of her robe to clean the sweat from his face. His body still shakes slightly as his breathing slows down. His eyes back asleep as he falls asleep again in her lap. She sighs as she carefully pulling the blanket over his body. She looks up at the moon that has nearly going to bed to give way to the morning sun.



“Zell…what happened to you.” her eyes look back down at his face as she rubs his hair with her soft gentle hand. His face is that of a sleeping child, very innocent. She smiles at him looking at the distance to see the moon starting to fall below the horizon and behind her the morning sun is getting ready to start its own daily journey once again. She lets him sleep until the sun fully peaks above the horizon as the moon flowers are no longer glowing and look like the rest of the flowers, which is why they are also hard to find during the day. The morning sun fills the meadow around them, his eyes twitch and move under his eye lids. Her face with concern as her hands rest on his head and shoulders. 



His eye’s opening slowly to a hazy vision, blinking a couple more times he slowly leans up, her hands fall into her lap warm from his head. She watches as he looks around, stretching his body twisting his upper half to see her behind him, spinning around to sit facing her. Her eyes searching for answers in his, as he looks at her with confusion. “What’s wrong Avaria?” he says with a big yawn. His eyes still waking up, his mouth parched. “You were restless in your sleep. I was woken up to your body as it heated up and started to sweat almost like you had an illness. I tried to wake you up, but you wouldn’t I got scared for you, then like nothing at happened your body returned to normal, and you feel asleep in my lap.” her eyes searching his face.



Rubbing the back of his neck and trying to get the crick out of his neck his eyes slowly waking up, “I don’t know what you're talking about, but I did have this strange dream.” as he explains to her what it was about, she rubs her chin. As she looks at him, “Well, you scared me that’s all. I just met you, be my luck you die next to me.” she shakes her head as she giggles to herself to hide the truth of her being scared. 



He slowly stands up as his legs are stiff, doing some daily stretches he does every morning she looks up at him. He offers her his hand; she takes it with a warm smile. Her heart skipping a beat as she feels his worn-down hands, the callous and scars from the years of hard work on the farm. Her’s soft as silk, while she does hunt and fight on her own. She hasn’t had to survive like he did, she had a whole clan to help support each other. Making her way to her feet, letting go of his hand she shakes thoughts like that out of her head. Her big smile from before shows itself. The horses also waking up standing to their feet, she gathers up her bedroll and blanket putting them back in their place within her small pack she carries. The pouch of gold that was hidden under the bag tucked under her robe as she attaches it to her belt under her robes. 



Zell catches a sneak peak of the clothing under it, simple leather pants and leather shoes cover her feet. The white robe she wears stained with dirt and grass from the night of flower picking. Securing the pack to her horse’s saddle, he with no such thing instead choosing to climb onto his horse shortly followed by her. As he sees she’s skilled with the horse he smiles. “I see you know how to ride.” his smile wide with joy. She smiles back and nods patting her hunting bow that’s attached to the saddle as well. “My father taught me; he was one of the best horse riders in the lands. Also skilled at archery from horseback, a hard skill to learn I might add.” She giggles as she clicks her heals against the horse taking off towards the city. Zell smirks as he watches her trot off, looking back south to where his home lies then smiling. “I’ll be back, I promise.” he then directs his horse and follows Avaria catching up to her. Making small talk as they follow a path he didn’t see before.



"Hold on! There was a path?" he exclaims, looking down at the ground in surprise. The horse hooves stepping in sync as he rides next to her on his horse. “Yea, you didn’t miss it though. Funny enough where you found me is where it ends or starts depending on how you see it. We never go farther south than the path. Sadly, the best Moon Flowers are there so I have to be careful.” she explains to him, her hand rubbing the side of her horse as it almost seems to neigh with happiness.



“You and your horse are well bonded; it was a rare thing to see on the farm. We never had time to bond with them before they were sold off to help pay for the farm.” He says as he does the same thing to his horse, the horse doesn’t respond like hers though. She giggles at him, “Yea Lucia and I have been through a lot, I learned to ride her at the age of 5. She is getting older, but I don’t mind taking things more slowly. Let’s me take in the beauty that’s around us.” A gentle breeze blows across the vast meadow of flowers as they move with the wind almost revealing itself. It’s beautiful and mesmerizing to witness. Birds flying above as they soar high into the air, the small critters on the ground scurry along the flowers to help hide them from the birds above. 



“So, Zell, tell me about yourself? Why do you seek the fame that you chase?” she asks.



He thinks for a moment before responding to her question, “Ever since I was a kid I wanted more, more knowledge, more power. I want to be strong and provide for my parents, well foster parents. I do not know my real ones.” his thoughts to them as he pauses before speaking again. “My foster parents found me alone in the meadows, I was an infant at the time when they found me. The only thing they could find was the blanket I was wrapped in had the symbol of Alvalice.” she interrupts him. “What ever happened to it? The blanket. It would have been useful.” she giggles to herself. His face looks at her with sadness but also annoyance as he clears his throat to continue, “As I was saying, they raised me on their horse farm, saving up enough money to send me to the local school nearby the farm. My whole life in school I was bullied for being different. They mocked me, pinned me down, beat me up. All I could do was endure the pain from them.” she nods to him; she can’t empathize with that as she never had to endure that kind of hardship. “Then one year I had this teacher who was an ex-captain of the king’s army. He witnessed me being attacked in his class one day but the usual school bullies, and though he tried to intervene, I refused his help. I purposefully endured the blows until I learned their violent tactics, which he described as barbaric. He took me under his wing after that for a year until he succumbed to illness. Though our time together was short, the training he gave me helped me grow stronger and defend those who took me in when I was left for dead. It was my 21st birthday yesterday, and today I've decided to venture out on my own. My parents sacrificed and saved up to buy me this sword that I now carry with me.”



Patting the sword that’s in a makeshift spot in the saddle of his horse; her eyes looking down at her own horse. The words process in her mind, “You were shaking in your sleep, something about an infant. Your story reminded me of it.” her head looks up and then turns to him, the horses still trotting towards the city. “My life is more boring than that, born into the Huntsman Clan I was raised with a loving family and friends. Working together we never struggled, but we survived. Our clan hunts in the meadow and forest to the west given special permission from the king himself. We sell the pelts to wandering traders as they pass us, the rest get stocked up and once a month they travel to the city walls to try and sell their stock.”



As they continued their small talk, the morning sun transformed into a scorching afternoon heat. The towering walls of the city loomed closer as they made their way towards the gate, revealing a bustling scene of people and activity within. Traders and merchants clamored outside the walls, offering their goods at inflated prices to unsuspecting travelers. The pristine white walls were adorned with vibrant flags bearing the emblem of the city, fluttering gently in the breeze. The sounds of the city grew louder as they approached, a symphony of voices and bustling activity. At the gates, heavily armored guards atop majestic horses stood watch, eyes trained on all who entered and exited through the south gate.



“Wow! So many people.” Zell exclaims as they come to stop shortly into the city walls, buildings taller than trees in the forests nearby cover the land. Cobblestone roads and paths for carts and people to walk on to navigate the giant city. “It looks so much bigger on the inside.” Avaria says with a smile in her words. With each step, the city unfolds before you. The hustle and bustle of merchants and shoppers fills the streets, their horses moving at a slow and steady pace. Guards in shining armor patrol the roads, their presence a reminder of the city's security. The shops are bursting with life, every inch filled with colorful goods and trinkets. It is a stark contrast to the peaceful meadows they had left behind. As they venture deeper into the city, the crowds grow thicker and more chaotic. Yet, the horses continue on, navigating through the maze of bodies without hesitation. They arrive at the south side within the heart of Alvalice - a bustling square adorned with a towering water fountain at its center. The air is filled with the sound of children playing and adults shopping for their necessities.



On the northern side of the square stands a grand building that houses the royal family and their guard. The massive metal gates bear the crest of the kingdom and stand as a barrier to those who are not welcome within. Behind these gates lies a path leading up to the main steps of the castle. Heavily armored guards line the path, their metallic armor reflecting the sunlight like polished mirrors. They stand tall and stoic, ever vigilant for any signs of danger. The castle itself reaches towards the sky, its white walls glistening in the sunlight. Flags adorn its walls and turrets, representing different parts of the kingdom. The unique white color of Alvalice is due to its close proximity to the sea, which can also be tasted in the metallic tang that lingers in the air.



To the west the path leading to the west gate, past the square on that side of town the less fortunate are housed. The streets are lined with beggars and citizens wearing tattered clothing. It was known as Beggar’s Alley to the rest of the city, most of the citizens on this side of the square are refuges made up of adventurers or merchants who wish to make it big but failed. Losing all they own, stuck on the street begging anyone who passes by for even a scrap of food. King’s guards patrol up and down the road but do no move deeper into the section. Deep inside there is said to be a woman who controls the Thief’s guild that was formed long time ago. A certain smell emanates from that direction as the breeze blows into our faces. 



To the east of the square, a bustling pathway can be seen, teeming with merchants and their wares. This is the main trade route on land that leads to Kagilka. The streets are lined with shops of all kinds - blacksmiths, tailors, jewelers, and potion makers. It's a hub for commerce and anything one might need can be found here. This road also serves as the only access point to the docks below the city, known as Port Alvalice - the busiest port in the world. As the road winds behind the grand castle at the center of the city, it is home to many middle-class residents who enjoy its convenient proximity to both their shops and the port. Approaching the north gate that leads out to the bustling docks, one can feel the energy and excitement of this prosperous city.



The path down the side of the cliff was made by a previous merchant who funded it, he also became the mayor of the port his authority second to none other than the king himself. Deacon's ancestors had a legacy in their town: his great-great-great great grandfather not only built and financed the road but also contributed to the development of the port into what it is today, making Deacon a respected figure as the current mayor. Before this they had to travel to the southern port which was more flat and easier to access but the couple days journey from there to Alvalice caused delays in goods. So, because of his family the city was able to prosper more and more. The path although a few hours journey by foot drastically shortened the time to bring goods into the city and continent. To save time and money, as well as greed Deacon’s grandfather-built warehouses to store merchandise as it enters the port. Shop keepers can rent this space for storage to allow them time to carry their goods back and forth or to save room for crates to be loaded onto the ships. His grandfather was a genius when it came to business and taught Deacon’s father and him the tactics he used. The idea was so profitable that his father-built Inn’s at the port for travelers to stay before they leave the port to the sea or up the cliffside to the city. It led to people staying, building houses along the shoreline. The city butts right up the cliffs that the city up top rests on. 



The port city still expands to this day, even some of the older merchant ships left at port tied together to form a network of house boats for people to stay in, the fishermen took to this greatly as they signed a deal with the mayor to allow only fishermen to stay in these boats to free up room on land. Allowing them to work and sleep in the same house, increasing their own profits. Every day they see hundreds of ships and thousands of people. Majority of the wealth and trade enter and leave the port as it never closes. Deacon, wanting to continue the tradition of adding to the port for the next generation of his family, has been in works with the ship builders and engineers to design a ship that doesn’t require wind to sail. Using the metals of Fereldian and the wood of the elves. The engineers of both Fereldian and Alvalice been testing using the metal to form tubes that suck water up and blow it behind the ship propelling it. While the testing has been mostly failures due to the tubes exploding. He hopes to soon have a working prototype to show to the world and his king.



Meanwhile as Avaria and Zell head towards the hospital attached to the square across from the castle on the south side. Zell watches as Avaria gets off her horse and ties to a post outside the doors in the streetside. Gathering her pack from the back of the saddle and tossing the straps over her shoulders as the pack rests on her back. She looks up at Zell, “Well, I guess this is where we part. Where are you going to head Zell? You said you wanted to join the army.”



Zell looks over to the castle gates and then back to her as he nods slightly, “Yea, I want to become stronger, do something.” she looks at the castle then back to Zell as she holds her hand out. Leaning down grabbing the saddle with one hand the other taking hers as he shakes it. She steps back as Zell turns towards the castle gates. Avaria to the doors of the hospital. Parting ways Zell’s horse trots slowly over to the castle gates weaving though the dense crowd some on horseback others walking. As he approaches the guards outside the gate they stand at attention as they wield spears, seeing a man on a horse approach the gates they point their spears in sync as one of them yells, “Halt!”



“This is the castle of our lord Horus, state your intentions horse rider.” The guards on alert but stoic in stance. Zell slows down as the horse comes to a stop a few feet from them, sliding off his saddle and grabbing the reins to keep the horse from running away. Patting the horse on the side of the head as he turns to face the guard who spoke. “I wish to join the King’s Army.” Zell states as he puffs his chest out. The two guards lower their guard returning the spear to standing up as the ends rest on the ground, they both laugh in unison. “You want to join the army huh?” one guard says. The other one leans down as he inspects the boy. “Go back to the farm you came from. We thought we could smell a pile of horse shit walking into the city.” the other guard says with almost a laugh.



Zell’s face turns to annoyance, “I meant it! I wish to join. I seek fame and fortune!”



The guards look at each other their faces feigning looks as Zell smiles at them with his chest still puffed out. “Haha well, you got spirit. Tell you what kid. Let me save you some time, there are many who seek what you seek. Look around, do you see us guards dripping in wealth? Do you see the gold pouring from our pockets.” The other guard speaks up, “Now-now he wants to join, why should we deny him that. I mean whats the best case scenario? He pisses his pants on the first day as he runs home to mommy, or died. Either way, we are rid of him.” As they give looks to each other they both shrug there shoulders, barely visible under the heavy armor. As the more kind guard points towards the east gate. “Head through the gate, to your left you should see the barracks. Talk to the guard at the gate he will guide you from there.” 



Zell looks at the east gate and then to the guards as he nods with confidence. The guards laugh again as they go back to their post. Zell climbs back into the saddle guiding the horse to the east. Walking out of the square the density of people somehow grows as merchants with their own cart and horse with goods in the back to be taken out and into the city, some turning left towards the port. He finds a spot between two carts that are heading towards the gate. Each full of crates with the emblem of the city on each one. Peaking into the carts he can’t tell what they are carrying. The street full of craftsman trying to get customers as they advertise their business. Sounds of the blacksmith hitting his anvil rings with a hypnotic rythum. Clothing and fabric shops full of ladies who are being shown around as the craftsmen boast how they are the best in the city. 



Amidst the bustling street, Zell makes his way smoothly to the east gate, which looks identical to the south gate he entered with Avaria earlier. As he walks down the road, he glances to the left but sees nothing but open space - no signs of any barracks or military presence at all. Frustrated and feeling deceived, Zell pulls off to the side and heads towards the left. Sitting on his horse, he stares out at an empty field and realizes that he was lied to about the army being stationed here. His face contorts with a mixture of embarrassment and anger as he turns around and rides up to one of the guards on horseback standing sentinel at the gate.



"Excuse me!" He calls out. "I was told there were supposed to be barracks here!" But his words fall on deaf ears as the guard remains motionless like a statue on his horse. Growing more annoyed, Zell trots in front of the guard and repeats himself. This time, the guard barely moves his head, his blue eyes peeking out from under the shadow of his helmet. "Move along," he says before returning to his post. Zell angrily runs his hand through his hair - he knows that's all he will get from this guard. He finds a spot to merge into the constant stream of people entering and exiting the gate and heads back inside. As he tries to figure out what to do next, his mind is filled with frustration and anger - he doesn't know anyone here and has nowhere to go.



Taking slow deep breaths, Zell calms himself down and starts heading towards the square again. The only person he can think of is Avaria - "What was her name again?" He racks his brain for a moment before finally blurting out "Avaria!"



To his surprise, he hears a familiar voice call out "Zell!" from the crowd. He spots her horse and sees her making her way through the dense crowd. They both spot each other and he gestures for her to come join him on the side of the road. Maneuvering his horse, Zell meets up with Avaria as she walks through the crowd, ignoring the people yelling at her. They stop on the side of the road and Zell dismounts while Avaria joins him shortly after.



"So, how did your army endeavor go?" She asks as they start walking with their horses.



"Those bastards at the gate lied to me. I don't think they see me as worth it," Zell says with frustration evident in his voice as he clenches his fists.



Avaria frowns and stomps her foot slightly. "Well, they suck. They don't know what they're missing!" She tries to cheer him up, but Zell's head hangs down in defeat. "Well, now I have to go back home," he mumbles dejectedly.



Entering the busy square as the afternoon sun is past it’s halfway point in the sky. She leads them to the fountain the horses following behind them with the reins. Zell looks down at the water, its crystal clear as the breeze blows a few strands of hair around. The sound of the water splashing is downed out by the noise of city. The horses make their own way to the water at the bottom of the fountain they both drink from it. Avaria sits down on the edge of the fountain it’s foundation has built in benches for people to sit and relax at. Setting her pack on her lap as her hands wades through the top of the water. Zell’s face staring back at itsself as her hand causes the reflection to ripple. He looks at her, his hands at his side. 



“What are you looking for?” he asks watching her riffle through her pack, pulling out something thats covered with some cloth. As she unwraps it in her palm setting on top of the cloth is a piece of cake. As she giggles handing it to me, her face blushing a shade of deep red. Zell takes it into her hand, the cake is soft like a fluffy pillow. It has a shean to it as the sunlight hits it as a layer of glaze is covering it. Inside are small pieces of fresh fruits from the mornings arrival. 



Zell looks down at Avaria as a tear forms in his eyes. She just smiles as she looks up with him with a look that's comforting. “Happy late birthday Zell!” She says gesturing her him to eat, he grabs the small piece of cake his hands to big and the cake soft his hands trying to rip it in half gently as he mangles it falling into several pieces. His face turns white as he looks at her, her face mostly unchanged but he can tell she's holding back a laugh.



He picks up several of the smaller pieces of cake, trying to divide it up evenly as he hands her the other half of pieces. Her eyes widen as she opens her mouth. Her hands gesture in the air, “No no! It's for you! I couldn't decide what to spend my money on so I followed my nose!* She presses her finger to her nose as she takes a big sniff. “Seems the old girl still has a nack for snacks.” She keels over with laughter when she realizes that she just rhymes. “I'll have to remember that one.” She speaks to herself wiping the tears of laughter from her eyes. Leaning back up Zell still holding the other half to her.



“Thank you Avaria but this was your money. You were supposed to get something for yourself.” His voice with a bit of sadness to it as his hand still outstretched to her in his palm the cloth with broken pieces of cake on it. Before she can grab the cake as her eyes change to that of surprise and affection. Her hand starts to reach for the cake as her horse butts in and eats the pieces almost taking his hand off.



As he backs away quickly the cloth flying away in the breeze the horse inhaling the cake as both him and her look at the horse who's now pushing its nose into Zell trying to find food. “I'm so sorry Avaria!” Zell says trying to push the horses head, it's nose trying to dig into empty pockets. Then finding the hand that was holding the cake, a bit of glaze stuck to his fingers. The horse sticks it's tounge out licking the fingers. Zell pulling his hand back and up to his chest he flicks his fingers. “Shoo you. Just because you're her horse doesn't mean you get to be rude.” She watches as he berates her horse, and the horse just looks at him with no expression. Zell hears laughing, quiet at first and then growing louder as he hears her fall to ground. She's rolling on the cobblestone street her arms clutched to her chest and her hands to her mouth as her face is so red as she tries to hold back laughing so hard.



“WHAT'S SO FUNNY!” Zell looks down at her on the ground rolling with laughter. His arms at his hips, her horse seizes the chance and then sneaks back into Zell’s pocket. A crowd of people from around as they watch this horse dig into this guy's pocket with a woman lying on the ground with laughter bursting from her belly. 



Zell looks around as his face gets red with embarrassment. His foot stomps like a little kid, she finally stops rolling as her horse loses interest in his pockets to her on the ground nudging her. As she finishes rolling around, laying on her back, the sun shines on her body. A few laughs still escaping as she settles down. The horse nudging her sides. She pats the side of the horse’s head as she stands up, brushing herself off. “Alright, I hear you. I swear you bring truth to the phrase I could eat a horse.” As she says eat a horse the eyes of her horse light up with subtle fear as it backs up. “Yeah, you would eat a horse if you could and still have room you know it.” Leaning over towards the horse her finger taps the horse’s head. Zell could swear he heard the horse say something but shakes his head he must have imagined it.



She turns to Zell her finger still tapping the horses head, “Horses eat for free at the stables outside the gates. The huntsman clan gets free feed for horses, part of the deal we have with the old King Horus over there.” As she points to the castle that he was rejected from. “Don't remind me of that place.” He says with a long face. She looks at him and then her horse and then to him and then her horse. “What's with the long face.” She slaps her knee as her long black hair falls over her head with her body keeling over again. Her hand resting on the side her horse to stable herself as she leans up whipping her hair back behind her head again more tears of laughter wiped away with her hands.



“Man Zell, You and me! We will make an excellent team.” She says her face with a big grin. Her hands are her hips almost posing. The crowd mostly dispersed by this time. Zell looks at her with confusion, “Team? What team? I never agreed to anything. You offered the cake!” He speaks as his face turns red with shying embarrassment.



“Well, you and I are sticking together now!” Walking over to him as she pushes her fist into his shoulder. “Let’s get to the stables so we can feed the horse before she decides to eat you too.”
