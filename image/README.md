3. **Error Isolation**: Failures in image processing don't affect other systems
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Image systems can be scaled independently
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting

### **Image System Queue Integration Pattern**
```python
class ImageGenerator(QueueProcessor):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("image_generator")
        # Image system initialization
    
    def _process_item(self, item):
        """Process queue items for image operations"""
        operation_type = item.data.get("type", "unknown")
        
        if operation_type == "generate_image":
            return self._handle_generate_image(item.data)
        elif operation_type == "process_image":
            return self._handle_process_image(item.data)
        elif operation_type == "analyze_image":
            return self._handle_analyze_image(item.data)
        else:
            return super()._process_item(item)
```
