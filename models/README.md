## How It Works

1. **Model Storage**: Models are stored in JSON format for easy loading and modification
2. **Training Data**: Raw training data is processed and stored for model improvement
3. **Configuration**: Model parameters and settings are stored separately from code
4. **Versioning**: Models can be versioned and updated without code changes

## Usage

- **Development**: Models can be modified and tested independently
- **Training**: New training data can be added to improve model performance
- **Configuration**: Model parameters can be adjusted without code changes
- **Backup**: Models can be backed up and restored easily

## File Formats

- **JSON**: Primary format for model data and configurations
- **Markdown**: Documentation and examples
- **Text**: Raw training data and logs
