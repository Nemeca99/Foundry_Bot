- **Model**: Deepseek or similar powerful model for nuanced dialogue
- **Function**: Each DigiDrone type gets unique AI personality that evolves
- **Memory**: Remembers interactions, develops quirks, has emotional states
- **SCP Integration**: Each drone has its own personality but is part of the Aether hive mind

### **CPU (Ollama) = Game Backend Engine**  
- **Role**: Handles all the game mechanics, stats, database, rules
- **Model**: Qwen or similar efficient model for logic processing
- **Function**: Manages training, evolution, health, experience, database operations
- **Memory**: Game state, player data, creature stats

### **Shared Memory System**
- **Purpose**: Connects both AI engines
- **STM**: Short-term memory for recent interactions
- **LTM**: Long-term memory for persistent learning
- **Function**: Biomimetic memory that mimics human cognition
